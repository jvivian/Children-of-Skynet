tomorrow we'll be going to panama for the opening of our new hotel. it's a fantastic building in a fantastic location.
perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in washington ...
congress is back.time to cut cap and balance.there is no revenue problem.the debt limit cannot be raised until obama spending is contained.
republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @barackobama in today's debt talks--first and foremost cutcap and balance.
the art of the deal-- the best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have. cut cap and balance.
if only @obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening israel's borders then america would be on the path to solvency.
@johnboehner message for house gop the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. - the art of the deal.
@obama - iranian weapons killing americans in iraq? what are u doing about this?
obamacare tragedy primed to further explode the deficit and @obama transferred $500 billion from medicare to fund it!
house gop wants to cut medicare obama took $500 billion from medicare for obamacare. both wrong!
derek jeter's baseball and more in today's #trumpvlog...
on our youtube channel- the opening of the incredible trump ocean club in panama....
@johnboehner mr. speaker bring the balanced budget amendment to the floor for a vote! let's get the ball rolling.
@johnboehner much as it pays to emphasize the positive there are times when the only choice is confrontation. the art of the deal
@macmiller donald trump the song gets 16m hits on youtube. who wouldn't be flattered?
more thoughts on the debt ceiling in today's #trumpvlog...
@johnboehner debt ceiling- sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal.
my interview last night with greta on the gop going el foldo
while @barackobama tries to push gun control --he still has not answered for project gun runner
@barackobama you have abandoned israel and engaged the muslim brotherhood and even the arab world does not like it
us news named the top10 best hotels in the us--and trump int'l hotel & tower nyc and trump int'l hotel & tower chicago are on the list!
take a look at and to see these beautiful hotels.
cut cap and balance. taxed enough already!
what is better advice- the art of the deal or rules for radicals ? i know which one @barackobama prefers.
who will be the next @therealteenusa? find out this saturday at 8pm et on missteenusa.com #teenusa
@barackobama you have increased discretionary spending by 25 annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. t-e-a
@marcorubio is right. we need to create more taxpayers not more taxes. cut cap and balance.
congratulations to my daughter ivanka and her husband jared on the birth of their daughter arabella rose yesterday.
#trumpvlog the republicans must act now don't let @barackobama push you around....
@barackobama has sold guns to mexican drug lords while his doj erodes our 2nd amendment rights.

my interview with @gretawire last night -- everything obama does is a 'campaign speech'
@barackobama is so inept that i think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the joint session on september 7th. just sad.
make no mistake---fast and furious goes all the way to the white house.
the white house is predicting 9 unemployment throughout 2012 and when obama care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.

why did we spend billions of our money on libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? what do we get out of this?
a simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector.
why did @barackobama liberate libya and do nothing for the iranian protestors? iran is a threat to our national security.
the misery index is at a 28 year high.
why do we continue to sit idly by while china steals our national security and corporate secrets? china is an enemy not a friend.

the delegates at the @dnc convention keep shouting four more years. four more years of 18 real unemployment and another $6t in debt?

there are now 119000 fewer americans employed than there were in july. the economy is still terrible.
unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.not a real recovery phony numbers
this chart from aei's @jimpethokoukis shows how terrible @barackobama's 'recovery' really is: disaster.

trump: if republicans 'don't get tough they're not going to win this election' via @thehill
on this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that bin laden's last sight was a navy seal pulling the trigger.
the onus of the chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union. inexcusable to leave children without school.
whatever happened to obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? where's the media?
84 of us troops wounded & 70 of our brave men & women killed in afghanistan have all come under obama. time to get out of there.
why won't obama release his college applications? is there something 'foreign' about them?
china is an international pariah. they are now harassing japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands
priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime obama has skipped over 50 of his intel briefings
amazing. @celebapprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.

i always said the people we fought for in libya were bad news. once again i was right.
libya is selling its oil to china--i notice the chinese ambassador is very safe.
obama is a disaster at foreign policy. never had the experience or knowledge. he is not capable of doing the job.
the middle east is blowing up--we didn't back egypt and now they riot against us. iran is using iraqi airspace cont
as bad as they were i don't remember our embassies being attacked when mubarak and gaddafi were in power.
what did we get for fighting in libya besides a dead ambassador. demand their oil.
it's wednesday how many more of our embassies will be stormed by islamists?
opec will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. they are always ripping us off.
so obama can host the muslim brotherhood pres. morsi in the white house but doesn't have time for @netanyahu?
it's disgraceful that the obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic cont
obama will go down as the worst president in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
no surprise. @dnc displayed russian ships in tribute to vets did they mean to honor the russians?
those who refuse to draw red line to iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @israel. -- @israelipm @netanyahu
i guess obama's cairo speech really worked out. the muslim brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. imagine if obama speaks in beijing?
deja vu - i can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed president. obama carter.
our $16t national debt is now bigger than our $15t gdp. if obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.

obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst president we have ever had.
with the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
romneys campaign is being put on the defensive. he cannot let this happen. stop pandering. must get tougher cont
if obama was smart he would cancel the muslim brotherhood's wh visit later this month. he won't.
wake up america! see article: israeli science: obama birth certificate is a fake
filming of the record 13th season of @celebapprentice has started. be sure to be on the lookout for future updates.
obama told @nbc that egypt is no longer an ally. they used to be until he pushed out mubarak.
shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9 11?
with allies like egypt and libya who needs enemies?!
what a coincidence that obama's good friends in libya and egypt picked 9 11 to attack our embassies.
the media is pathetic. our embassies are savaged by radicals while obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @mittromney.
i will be speaking monday september 24 10 a.m. at liberty university to a record setting student body. i look forward to it!
why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the muslim brotherhood in egypt?
it's thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @mittromney?
obama's convention bounce is gone. @mittromney has retaken the lead in the latest @rasmussenpoll
.@mittromney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. obama who put these radicals in power deserves blame.

@scottsaia23 thanks scott. i appreciate your nice words.
it's amazing--@hardball chris has completely lost all connections to reality. he is a complete shill for obama.
why doesn't obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in egypt have live ammunition? they need it fast.
rt @mittromney: for nearly 4 years barack obama has refused to crack down on china's cheating & american workers have paid the price.
@steelchecker jody--agreed.
@shawn maynard this is our 13th season. no precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. shooting is underway. will be terrific.
qe3 is going to further sink the dollar into oblivion. creates artificial numbers for short term market gains. cont
no surprise--obama's deputy campaign manager tweeted link from chinese propaganda outlet did she also write it?
first obama says egypt is not an ally. then he promises to keep handing over aid incompetent and unqualified.
if you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read the art of the comeback.
hey @kimkardashian--i hear you are undecided in the election. i can explain why you should vote for @mittromney.
weekly jobless claims are up once again. the economy cannot recover with obama in office.

with 49 days until the election @mittromney needs to stay on offense. he should not be apologizing. deflect onto obama's record.
the majority of americans agree with @mittromney's comments on @israel and iran.
it's tuesday. how many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores obama's record?
none of romney's leaked comments change the fact that obama is a complete disaster. 20 real unemployment and $6t in deficit spending.
liberal press won't look into why obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with romney's private comments.
.@lightjzup industrial turbines are destroying our land.

@danojano @afreespeechzone dopey--i have never filed for bankruptcy as you know!
obama should play golf with republicans & opponents rather than his small group of friends. that way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
the stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting!
technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.

just left liberty university. chancellor jerry falwell jr.& his father have done an amazing job...great school & the students were fantastic
why did @mittromney give his tax returns without demanding that obama release his college records & applications in return?
the republican party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. they must be tough and smart.
with all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
the emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
amazing race winning an emmy again is a total joke. the emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.
the emmys are all politics that's why despite nominations the apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
all these polls released by news outlets are oversampling democrats. they want to influence public perception of the race.
despite all of china's cheating they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
the attack on our libyan consulate was the worst attack on the us since 9 11. time for obama to come clean.
with obama and bernanke destroying the value of the dollar gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
rt @mittromney: i am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it.
today i spoke @libertyu convocation a great crowd...
scary--obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
living in denial--only 15 of democrats think that recent economic news is poor
secure your place at the national achievers congress in london. it will be an amazing event with a great surprise.
the debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @mittromney has proved--in florida--he delivers under pressure.
home values have sunk a record 15 under obama.
coincidence? obama and ahmadinejad each describe @israel's warning over the iranian nuclear program as just 'noise'

.@brandonhardest love what you do and work hard.

47m on food stamps. over 23m americans unemployed. 50 of college grads unemployed. and obama wants us talking about big bird.
delusional--obama actually thought that he won the debate what is he thinking?
receiving thousands of thank you letters from @libertyu students for my convocation speech. the honor was all mine! great people.
obama was guest at vp debate moderator martha raddatz's wedding do people think this is fair?
a-rod must be dropped in the yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. he simply can't perform without drugs.
consumer spending fell in september another indicator the 7.8 unemployment number is cooked.
you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving big bird. -- @mittromney
i am more concerned about biden in the debate than i am about obama. be careful on thursday night!
even with lower profit projections american firms are still throwing money into china obama is killing investment.
congratulations to @flgovscott on getting an a grade from @catoinstitute on his fiscal policy. rick is a fantastic governor.
i enjoy meeting tourists in #trumptower. people travel from across the world to see the five-level atrium & waterfall.
must read article on obama's illegal fundraising from abroad foreign candidate getting foreign donations.
@usa67us thank you
when everything seems to be going against you remember that the airplane takes off against the wind not with it. -- henry ford
great move to take a-rod out of game. now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation drugs .
asking why my dislike of a-rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
staff at trump park avenue disliked a-rod--to put it mildly -- the staff at trump world tower loves derek jeter.
.@apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am et on the @todayshow with @mlauer
i guess they have lance armstrong cold. brutal report. a waste of taxpayer money to take down an american hero.
$30m a year and a-rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th see my prediction
amazing that derek jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
if @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. a beater is always a beater--just watch!
i suspect @joebiden could do well tonight. don't be fooled by his gaffes. he is a seasoned and feisty debater.
outright disgusting--the obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to us amb. sean smith's mother
why the hell did we help the libyan rebels in the first place. that is the real scandal.
how the hell does the libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
live tweeting during tonight's vp debate...should be a great time
our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in u.s. history
so obama used to tell classmates that he was kenyan royalty and an indonesian prince sounds like his book bio!
it's thursday and only 26 days until the election. how many illegal donations from china and saudi arabia did obama collect today?
why does barack obama's ring have an arabic inscription? who is this guy?
another sign that @jack welch is right. new government labor report casts even more doubt on the september jobs data
.@linda mcmahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to dc. support her campaign here
looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
get ready- this should be informative and fun! #vpdebate
both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #vpdebate
hard for biden to justify libya mess but doing best he can. #vpdebate
biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #vpdebate
excellent story on @mittromney- very good moment for ryan. #vpdebate
biden's statements on medicare are very effective. ryan must now come back and combat. #vpdebate
pretty even debate- no knockouts. however ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. what do you think? #vpdebate
going over to @todayshow now to introduce @apprenticenbc cast etc.-- watch.
british pm cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying scottish windmills.
wing bangers -- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the u.s.
obamacare is a complete disaster. many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. terrible.
@dennisrodman @apprenticenbc great to have you back for the best season yet!
there are many ways of going forward but only one way of standing still. -- pres. franklin d. roosevelt
first minister of scotland released bomber of pan am flight #103 on compassionate grounds. do you believe?
doing the @todayshow with @mlauer was great- i really like matt.
credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #vpdebate
my scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
i'm going to the @yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when i am there.
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
great to hear that our loyal @celebapprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. this will be something special!
with our amazing all star cast @joan rivers @johnrich @arsenioofficial & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. the price of corn alone has risen over 200 since he was elected.
what we are watching on our tv screens is the unraveling of the obama foreign policy. --@paulryanvp
very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
i look forward to tuesday night's presidential debate--i wonder if obama will use my name again.
when an employee leaves me and begs to come back--i never let them. loyalty is very important.
leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. -- warren g. bennis
i told you whenever i go to a @yankees game the @yankees win.
when strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency washington will say what were we doing .
washington should have brought in strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
i'll bet obama goes down just like washington because he doesn't use our this country's best people to win.
joe girardi did a great job of managing the yankees this series.
they found jessica in colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
everyone's wondering what's wrong with a-rod. not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.
tonight despite everything put a-rod in the lineup.
roadway steel on beautiful verrazano-narrows bridge is rusting and rotting away. scrape and paint before too late.
so much for washington shutting down strasburg- they deserved to lose.
a bad thing finally happened to derek jeter--- he is a great champion.
.@yankees are in trouble without derek. try a-rod at short- get him some confidence.
swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
a-rod hit ball hard first at bat. time for him to step up and leave.
yankees can win today. kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
brooklyn nets have the worst uniform ever- boring- won't matter if they win winning solves all problems - cont
no i wasn't at the @yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. when i go they win.
i have never seen a thin person drinking diet coke.
.@mittromney's poll numbers are looking really good. one more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.
who says obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the boeing.
a-rod is just not making it. we want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
i love @libertyuniversity--such great people!
derek jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at trump world tower- i told him not to sell- karma?
a-rod was a great player when he lived at trump park avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
lots of response to my comment on diet coke-let's face it it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
isn't it time that obama release his college records and applications? boy would that create a mess! he is not who you think.
barack obama is not who you think he is. most overrated politician in us history.
looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @mittromney supporters at the intrepid. mitt's doing well.
a-rod should donate his contract to charity. he doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. he is a $30m yr rip off.
once again obama fails to classify china as a currency manipulator. he just helped china steal even more jobs and money from us.
romney ryan slam obama administration on china currency manipulation via @abc
obama is planning on attacking romney on bain in tomorrow's debate mitt should bring up college applications & records
if @mittromney has a good debate tomorrow night obama is finished!
sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride let time go by. donald j. trump
the invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. -- @mittromney
based on very popular demand i will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the presidential debate.
donald trump's back with 14 'apprentice' all-stars via @ap
gov. gary johnson pulling votes from @mittromney--don't waste your vote. obama must go!
@jbluvx2 happy birthday!
i hope a-rod has a great night for the yankees--he owes it to them--especially with derek hurt.
lots of pressure on obama tonight--even more than a-rod. if he doesn't perform well it could be over.
i have no doubt that mitt will do really well tonight. we'll all be watching @mittromney.
i turned down going to the debate tonight so that i could do live tweets to my many followers.
verlander is great but very beatable. does not have a good era in playoff games
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right it will be a nightmare for @israel if obama is re-elected.
i can confirm the reports--@billrancic my first season winner will be returning to this all-star season of @celebapprentice.
.@antbaxter your documentary died many deaths. you have in my opinion zero talent.
.@antbaxter thanks for helping promote & make trump international golf links scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
diet coke tweet had a monster response--dammit i wish the stuff worked.
obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. at least he is consistent.
it's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @cnbc draw the highest ratings. and they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
the coca cola company is not happy with me--that's okay i'll still keep drinking that garbage.
because obama was so pathetic in the first debate tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
.@history's wonderful the men who built america with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing i'll be live tweeting the debate
.@antbaxter i tried watching but fell asleep.
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the republican party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
between libya the national security leaks and fast & furious obama has had more national security scandals than any other president.
.@washtimes @brettmdecker: five questions w @realdonaldtrump--'lack of leadership is the biggest threat to america'
i bet the terrorists in libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in benghazi.
congratulations to @jamesokeefeiii on exposing more democrat voter fraud. @dnc was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
good luck @mittromney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
.@mittromney--if obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
@missusa olivia--we love you. you are doing a great job.
get ready for tonight!
if the @yankees can somehow beat verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. and i will go to games 6& 7 so they will win!
great win last night by peyton manning & @denver broncos in san diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. very impressive.
for political purposes only obama is planning to hit libya for the benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
@drumline mormon it is selling great at macy's--thanks!
we should be able to negotiate a deal with iran because they know we could blow them away to the stone age.they just don't believe we would.
i was just told by one of the top @pgatour players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. very nice compliment--i agree.
getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say let's get ready to rumble !
why hasn't obama created jobs?
why has obama let china and others take our jobs?
good response on jobs by @mittromney.
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
.@mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential!
obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? it's all talk.
obama just said @mittromney was a very successful investor --- big mistake for obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @mittromney is looking strong and sharp.
obama weak on immigration. all words no action. he's been prez 4 years.
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton-- he is no bill clinton.
.@mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems. obama has no answer.
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama. no wonder nothing gets done.
you talk tough mr. president but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy.
obama better than last time but again @mittromney wins. good night. #debate
debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. at one point it looked like they would come to blows.
george will said best debate he ever saw . if you ever heard george will speak boring anything is exciting.
stupid george will gave @mittromney no chance 3 months ago. take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
verlander pitched great but @yankees look truly defeated.
at the debate the president kept talking of what he is going to do. i kept saying why didn't he do it? he lost me a long time ago.
remember i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartment...its been lucky for you. the day after he sold it he broke his foot.
i still love derek he is a winner!
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. if we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period!
do you believe barack hussein obama aka barry soetoro looked like a president last night? i don't!
obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
polls are starting to look really bad for obama. looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. don't put it past him!
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
my twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the biggies. it's like having your own newspaper.
my interview with @realmichaelkay discussing why a-rod should be fired from @yankees & how to terminate his contract
@marileenelson thanks
via @espn: donald trump would fire a-rod
really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @realmicihaelkay. i am a long time yankee fan.
great article on wind turbines by robert bryce in today's @nypost
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities.
remember new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer. be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
robert bryce @nypost--congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. windmills are a disaster.
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally & aesthetically.
all the guys that said @mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board. mitt will remember the early helpers.
obama was beaten but not knocked out. he lives to fight another day. but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
...bad decisions can be devastating.
trump was right: 'obama's america' tops 2012 documentaries via @newsmax media
.@mittromney scored last night on both substance and style.
obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
last saturday a-rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. but he was still hitting on girls from the dugout he is very selfish!
while the @yankees look like they quit and are finished they won't quit for cc
joe girardi @yankees must play his starters even a-rod they got you there.
@billrancic bill- you should have named your beautiful son donald.
just read about my friend @hulkhogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. see what happens when i am not mentioned.
michael vick of the philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
robert pattinson should not take back kristen stewart. she cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. he can do much better!
can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
what is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. we should be given credit for taking this risk.

if obama goes after mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obama's college records--all of them.

obama's spending and borrowing is burying america and destroying our children's future. does he even care?

robert i'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump kristen- but i'm right. if you saw the miss universe girls you would reconsider.
i think the @yankees will win today. unlike a-rod cc is good under pressure. i hope a-rod plays however.
now there is talk of a-rod being shipped to @marlins. if a-rod is not a @yankee next year the fans will be happy.
derek jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. derek--only in a trump building--trump is lucky for you.
while the next season of @celebapprentice is packed w all stars ours fans will be happy to see @joan rivers in the board room.she is back!
bad sign for obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. their internals must be horrendous.
when strasburg leaves @nationals for another team for more money will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
clinton commented in ohio today that @mittromney is right the economy has not been fixed under obama.i always said bill was an honest man.
it's thursday. how much money did barack obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
the last time i visited china i couldn't believe all the construction. you can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.

something really bad happened to the @yankees psyche--much like our president!
it is a great honor to have helped the community so much.
with barry diller & tina brown in charge did anyone doubt that @newsweek would be a massive failure?
great decision by donald graham @newsweek to sell. i'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall.
@evaemery never give up. you have what it takes.
.@mittromney did a great job last night. watch the clip!
obama said not optimal to ambassador & embassy killings--bad word usage for a harvard graduate.

no surprise welfare spending is up over 30 under obama. he is the food stamp & welfare king

7.8 unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.real unemployment is at least 15
derek jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in trump world tower.
derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. it will be lucky for him like in past.
good luck to derek on his operation. i know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
fort hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. respect the wounded and dead.
the biggest problem with a-rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the yankees--- he must go.

don't let obama play the iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful republicans!

the brass in #trump tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. i keep the atrium impeccable. key to its success!
obama planted that @nytimes story on iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. he wants libya and china off the table.
this is my last election. after my election i have more flexibility. obama to @medvedevrussiae discussing our nuclear arsenal.
obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@mittromney has many openings to attack especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden.
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart. in a couple of years he will thank me. be smart robert.
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obama---just wait and see!
i look forward to @mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi. cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden? they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit. all he did is say o.k.
former obama white house economic adviser @austan goolsbee gave his old boss a 'c' on the economy pretty generous!
well this is it the final debate- let's see how it goes. i'll be tweeting live.
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight. always treated me fairly.
.@mittromney looks much calmer and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
stop congratulating obama for killing bin laden. the navy seals killed bin laden. #debate
i will be doing @squawkcnbc at 7:30.
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. viewership will be way down.
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy-- and i mean much more.
70 of the chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago at least someone has done well under obama.
i always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. by stopping he gave his enemies an opening.
no matter what happens in the election @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. he has kept obama in it even with his terrible record.

china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject!
my announcement is tomorrow!
barack obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after bin laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
last night was the first time obama said we instead of i in respect to bin laden's killing.
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert & kristen.i don't have time except to say robert drop her she cheated on you & will again!
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. i only wish mitt was more aggressive!
thank you to @dailytelegraph reviewer @neilmidgley who stated 'you've been trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters...

rt @reuterspolitics: trump to give $5 million to charity if obama releases records
my offer to obama is about transparency. in 2008 american people were sold on hope and change. this our last chance to get the full record.
third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to obama. as sean says it is an easy $5 million to charity. what does obama have to lose?
i just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. a puppet of obama?
rt @apcampaign:trump to obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records #election2012
i am happy to donate $5 million to a charity barack obama chooses. all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. why can't he release his records? especially when $5m is going to charity.
... by releasing his records he can come clean with the american people and have $5 million go to a charity.
in light the benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public...
glad to hear north carolina is solid for @mittromney. it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the @ncgop convention.

i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute $5m to any charity of his choice. everyone wins. take the deal.
.@mark sanchez shouldnt be too upset over @evalongoria. he will always do great!
@michellemalkin i fully supported mccain but when he lost hoped obama would be great for u.s. --- he wasn't.
what will be the response on wednesday? if obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.

china is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports we need @mittromney to rein them in.
yesterday barack obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in china i don't think this was a gaffe.
for someone who demanded 20 years of mitt's tax returns you would think my offer to donate $5m to charity for his records is an easy go.
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires...
doing david letterman @late show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of sweeps.going into the lion's den but i've been there many times before. enjoy
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop $5m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
the dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants. --the america we deserve
letterman @late show was great last night. i had a lot of fun. you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the $ for charity.
lots of response that obama should give the $5m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi.
another great charity that the $5m could go to just a recommendation to the pres. - the wounded warriors represented so well by @traceadkins
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
based on the ovation last night from the letterman @late show audience i believe it will be hard for obama to throw $5m down the drain....
.@sabrinasiddiqui re: taylor and conor--great news for taylor!
@erizzle05 only because he has something to hide.
@ryanseven sounds like a good idea.
@lianneonlife i love the wounded warriors--obama should choose that as his $5m charity.
the letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity....

wow! letterman show @late show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? djt
the election is still close but trending toward @mittromney. he leads all national polls and obama's likeability is imploding. vote!
be careful of an obama bomb to win election! would be a horrible thing to do.
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. the middle east is a mess. yet colin powell still endorses him. wonder why?
...colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
by the way where is @oprah? good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported obama--now she is silent. anyway who cares i adore oprah.
pretty audacious for obama to call @mittromney a bser when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's dutchess county #gop dinner--to a sold out crowd. it will be great fun.
where's the transparency? despite obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with jeremiah wright.
my fellow tea party friends in ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day. know you can! must win ohio.
i have decided to add a caveat to my offer. obama can't decide to send my $5m to rev. wright if he releases his records.

many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- i agree.

while @bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct.

we are taking care of hundreds of people in the trump tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. free coffee and food.
direct view of crane from apartment window. crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze.
if authorities need direct view from top of trump tower call office.
all weights are on crane's wrong side --- very precarious below move out!
the water damage to nyc is amazing. the winds were bad but the water was worse.
i saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
hurricane is good luck for obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
not only giving out money but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president --- don't fall for it.
because of the hurricane i am extending my 5 million dollar offer for president obama's favorite charity until 12pm on thursday.
i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap i would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
people having a great time in the trump tower atrium --- unlike others i stayed open.
don't let obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
remember this: obama wants to raise taxes @mittromney wants to lower taxes--need i say more!
the trump tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks staff!
so many incredible friends said thanks for tt help --- i say thanks to you!
the election is trending towards @mittromney. americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the obama economic decline.
these last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4 gdp. obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in american history.

another great cause obama could send my $5m donation to is a charity for 9 11 first responders. they are american heroes.
i never fall for scams. i am the only person who immediately walked out of my ali g interview
without focus it's just impossible to be successful at anything. --midas touch
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on 9.12 the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi?
lets be honest if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in ohio on monday.

@digiphile @redcross rt if you think pres.obama should release his records to get $5m for charity--for red cross or another great charity
why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something?
people are happy that i left the trump tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.
scary. obama and the democrat senate have accrued over $5t worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years?
maybe obama should donate my $5m to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
chinas stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses their market gains the day we are hit by storm

how many illegal foreign donations will obama collect this final week? another scandal ignored by the liberal media.

nice to see obama released a situation room photo from sandy. how about releasing the photo taken during benghazi?
what is your thought as to why obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?

@dionnewarwick thanks for your nice statement on access hollywood. you are a great person and talent...i adore you!
well back to the drawing board!
we can't let this happen. we should march on washington and stop this travesty. our nation is totally divided!
lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! the world is laughing at us.
this election is a total sham and a travesty. we are not a democracy!
our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before.
our nation is a once great nation divided!
the electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
hopefully the house of representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up!
house of representatives shouldn't give anything to obama unless he terminates obamacare.

millions without electricity across ny & nj. the media has covered for obamas massive failure. can you imagine if this was another pres?
congrats to @karlrove on blowing $400 million this cycle. every race @crossroadsgps ran ads in the republicans lost. what a waste of money.

i will and i agree! rt @zacharyquinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!
obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects us credit downgraded again thanks for letting us know now
no surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating obama's win. they love a weak america that they can rip off.
.@davidaxelrod i'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @ivankatrump says hi.
with taxes set to go up and obama about to cut the mortgage deduction now is the time to buy a house if you can. can get a great deal.
at the end of the day obama won the battleground states by less than 500000 votes. this was a winnable race. gop needs to do better!
china's communist party has now publicly praised obama's reelection. they have never had it so good. will own america soon.
china's submarines will soon be carrying nukes they will be sent to patrol our coasts obama won't do anything.
china is heavily investing in building its own jet engine they will end up stealing the design from us as usual.
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8 7c on @history
romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in florida and ohio & he would be president.
polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8 7c on @history
of the 9 battleground states we only carried north carolina. i'm proud of @ncgop & glad i delivered keynote at their state convention.

medicare payments have become so unpredictable that record amount of doctors are now leaving bad for long term.
obama's deal raises taxes on 77 of national households. with obama care taxes kicking in now everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.
...remember--i told you so.
make sure you realize that this deal is only a stop gap measure.obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
this deal @rnc voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts. it is pathetic. obama is laughing at them.

the worst negotiators in history otherwise known as republicans have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months. pathetic!
republicans are always worried about their general approval. with proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.
watch this great behind the scenes video of @ivankatrump's spring 2013 photo shoot-
one positive from last week for lance was that everyone was focused on manti te'o! why did lance do that interview?
the tea party delivered the house for @gop so they could be fiscally responsible. instead they have been irresponsible!
has pres. obama or the white house told the public what happened in algeria yet? wheres the media?
scary. over 8332000 americans left the work force during obama's first term how did romney lose that election?
happy 8th anniversary to @melaniatrump.
pride yourself on your ability to find creative solutions to tough problems. - think big
i cannot believe the republicans are extending the debt ceilingi am a republican & i am embarrassed!

there is no world problem which cannot be solved if people of good will & intelligence want it to be.

come on goangelo don't give up now just because your rally at macy's drew only eleven people for twenty minutes! i love@ macy's.
dummy goangelo keep letting people know how great my shirts ties and cufflinks also success are at macy's.the best-now everyone's aware!
@wobby sobby wow timmy thanks..
congrats to @jimmiejohnson a great guy on winning daytona!
@mkasun. thanks.
@alexleiser33. thanks alex.
here we go with the oscars!
how do you like seth and oscars so far?
i don't like the opening even a little bit!
you are right-more like the opening of the tonys.
django unchained is the most racist movie i have ever seen it sucked!
very tacky set!
shirley b did a very good job singing goldfinger! not easy.
lincoln never sounded like that!
@scottflakne. thanks scott.
anne hathaway is a good winner!
sorry i never went bankrupt and don't wear a wig it's all mine !
the oscar broadcast is really boring - where is the glamour and beauty?
jane fonda and michael douglas look great!
i've had enough of this - good night!
i'll be doing fox and friends this morning at seven.
@5thmcfly. in april - thanks.
@arjuwan. great and thanks.
@fl richierich. great.
...overall the academy awards were very average at best.
last night william shatner had more airtime than any winner. it should have been called the william shatner show...
how did you like michelle obamas bangs last night?
why do losers & haters always say i wear a wig when they know i dont. like it or not its all minejust ask barbara walters.
whenever one of the morons say i wear a wig stop reading because they have no credibility & just hate.
@jurciuoli19 very good!
@jaderomaine thanks and good luck!
@dynomike3 hi mikey--work hard and good luck.
@roxannequintana thanks roxanne.
.... it is a very effective & commonly used business tool.
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals..
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
speaker john boehner who i like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazingthe funny thing is he cant stand them!
...so far he has been a complete failure at doing so. he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
an individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me.....
.@marissamayer is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. she is doing a great job!
@anchantra thanks--the big question is why!

donald trump blasts the oscars via @theblaze
via @mediaite: donald trump trashes 'tacky' 'boring' oscars blasts 'racist' django unchained
obama is making speeches excoriating the republicans and they never answer back. why arent they fighting?
must read column by bob woodward explaining how obama pushed for sequestration & promised no tax increase
the $85b sequester is just 2 of obama's $3.5t record deficit spending budget. our leaders are ruining our children's future.
the countdown is on. the 13th season of all-star @apprenticenbc premieres this sunday march 3rd at 9pm est on @nbc. big!
our leaders are terrible. the government spends over $50b a day. it cant find cuts for less than 2 days of spending?! sad!
obama is finally stopping the chinese from buying something in america windfarms what a joke!
... & all obama is concerned about stopping them doing is buying wind farms
china is buying gas fields in texas & stealing our corporate secrets...

that was some episode last week-we've got a great cast!
bret had a target on his back from the get go...
there's definitely no love lost between piers and omarosa.
trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $. looks like a good season for charities.
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
firing bret was a tough one for me-but omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
will plan b miss trace?
will team power be able to withstand omarosa as pm? smooth sailing is not expected.
my 757 is incredible-i think the teams agree on that.
which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
honest omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
trace delivers check to hospital in nyc: american red cross must be grateful to trace and his team for their tremendous work.
what do you think of gary's definition of f-u-n?
gary as the cat in the hat? he can work it out.
on the whole the teams seem to be working well together. no wars...yet.
what?! latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
next she says she's being set up by omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.
does anyone agree with marilu that gary while 'adorable' is a distraction?
re omarosa: nasty tough or smart...or all?
which team is your favorite?
it's true... dennis is really into this-very animated. i have never seen him this way before.
re my hair-should i change it? what do you think?
the losing team is now back in boardroom. i can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out.

people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...

for the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions i have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
haters stop saying i went bankrupt it is not so. i never went bankrupt...

please help @autismspeaks with their petition to the white house for a national strategy for the autism epidemic
take the time to be thorough in whatever you undertake. remain open to new ideas. remain fluid not fixed in your expectations.
everybody should contribute & fight in the long haul battle against autism. @autismspeaks
this weeks all-star celebrity @apprenticenbc features another memorable board room rumble between @piersmorgan & @omarosa.
wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. it's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.
achievers go for the challenge so the next deal is what they're thinking about. they have an obligation to best themselves.
find out who and what is the best in your field. identify the trendsetters leaders and authorities. learn the standards they follow.
have a great good friday and a happy easter.
@nikkio: @realdonaldtrump just read book contagious why things catch on - reminded me of u --ur one of a kind! : thank you!

north korea is reliant on china. china could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.
what do we get from our economic competitor south korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from north korea? - nothing!
@kaiser1859: @realdonaldtrump what is the solution mr trump? leadership!
@thejbrain: @realdonaldtrump very well said. the united states needs people like you to show what truly leadership means! so true!
@sullythinks: why is @realdonaldtrump not the president of the us right now?! a very good question!
we have tremendous economic power over china if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't! china's economy would collapse without us.
china is the biggest environmental polluter in the world by far. they do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
major article in new york times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in china and how it is rapidly growng! rest of world pays.
@kimstagliano: @realdonaldtrump when will nyt write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here mr. trump. they should kim!

.@alexsalmond @pressjournal rt @rdowns @realdonaldtrump margaret thatcher never would have allowed those wind mill monstrosities.
go for the jugular so that people watching will not want to mess with you. think big
opportunities only present themselves if you are out there looking for them. be aggressive and seize them when they come.
congratulations to @ivankatrump and jared on the big news. i will have yet another grandchild this fall!
congratulations to @nyknicks on winning their first atlantic division title since 1994. @carmeloanthony is a great new yorker and knick!

obamas budget spends $2b making our navy ships algae-powered the strong world is laughing at us.
mr. president it is time to lead on the korean crisis. make a statement from the rose garden and send a strong message to the man child!
interested is interesting. if you remember that simple rule you will have no trouble making conversation.- think like a billionaire
@rodmonium91 probably mark.

china controls north korea. so now besides cyber hacking us all day they are using the norks to taunt us. china is a major threat.
the only american who has met with the north korean man child is dennis rodman. isnt that frightening and sad?
where is the president? it is time for him to come on tv and show strength against the repeated threats from north korea -- and others.
be up front and direct with people and they will return the favor. think like a billionaire
always remember that as your success grows you will be asked for more favors. learn how to say no. it is critical.
my performance from last week on david letterman @late show will be re-aired tonight at 11:35 pm on cbs.
remember to take time this weekend to relax and regroup. it will pay major dividends for the next week.

south korea must in some form pay for our help-the u.s. must stop being stupid!

@mikeohio2323: @rob bieber @realdonaldtrump tell the victims and their families about this guy's rights. terrible!

@joetran19: @realdonaldtrump how do u feel about marco rubio? drinks too much water!
oh no they are worried that they didn't read the boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish? t
i just won a big court decision n.y. post against some character who claimed i owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
the shirts and ties at macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
i hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the boston killer as the suspect .
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings-maimings
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? we are not dealing with an innocent baby here-death
i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person with a very high iq with strong common sense
you are right the media is always offending donald trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the boston killer!
@nextlevelstoner great!
@ajbarker50: @realdonaldtrump do you try to make everything about you? yes!

@coachclintswan tell me what were they doing in the park playing checkers?
@bracybuilders: @realdonaldtrump just a playboy
bullshit-pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money split between brothers and sisters and i built it into over 9 bill.
can you imagine the boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse!
no mercy to terrorists you dumb bastards!
if the boston killer applies for obama care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
great sportscaster al michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on saturday morning at trump national la. he was in perfect shape!
i don't know how al michaels could have been drunk and arrested on friday night if he was totally sharp on saturday morning.
don't forget to watch celebrity apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
make the boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. once he is well he will say speak to my lawyers.
what do you think of water boarding the boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? i suspect he may talk!
seems like the teams are surprised when @thegarybusey comes back. #celebapprentice
.@traceadkins presents the nj coast red cross a $40000 check for sandy relief. you can tell hes very pleased about that--& rightly so.
.@bretmichaels and george ross are back as advisors. good to see them! #celebapprentice
everybody loves @bretmichaels! hes a great champion and this is where he should be. he agrees!
i hope you are watching the apprentice...tonight's show is great and brett michaels is back!
how stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already? #celebapprentice
.@thegarybusey is making no attempt to help. is he in buseyland? their team is short on help already #celebapprentice
.@traceadkins isnt excited about their ideas. are you? #celebapprentice
george ross could be right@thegarybusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #celebapprentice
this assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette. #celebapprentice
this assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #celebapprentice
george has a real twinkle about him says @therealmarilu. really? the shark should be scared. #celebapprentice
for you newcomers george ross was one of my first advisors on the original apprentice. #celebapprentice
romance or adventure- what do you prefer? #celebapprentice
looking forward to @thegarybusey's book of buseyisms !

dangerous. while obama is cutting down our military china has announced plans to build more aircraft carriers

we need another bush in office about as much as we need obama to have a 3rd term. no more bushes!
@dbagsloveme i will thanks!
@afolasoji so true.
@frankibe i certainly did--in spades.
house republicans should be doing everything possible to defund obamacare. instead leadership is funding it
do as i say not as i do.the politicians who passed obamacare are now exempting themselves from the monstrosity
must read article: immigration reform could be bonanza for democrats are the @rnc & @gop suicidal?
to be in charge you have to take responsibility you have to instill confidence. its like being a conductor--set the tempo.

just out- @apprenticenbc was in first place in all demos during the 10pm hour in the ratings.
i have a lot of @apple stock--- and i miss steve jobs. tim cook must immediately increase the size of the screen...
the white house correspondents' dinner was so boring this year- i guess thats because i didnt attend even...
next year @tombrokaw should be the comedian at the white house correspondents dinner. the only problem is that...
failed show @dannyzuker i have never heard of you and was told you are a loser-after reading your credits i have no questions about it!
.@dannyzuker i hear your filmography is stacked with failures.
.... but you only want to talk about 10 years later when i still win 10pm in all key demos.@dannyzuker
failed show @dannyzuker season 1 of @apprenticenbc had 28 million viewers and 41.5 million watching.....
.@apprenticenbc season 13 still #1 at 10pm in all key demos despite having to serve as our own lead in from 9-10. 11pm news loves trump!
.@richardroeper- perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz once you went on it was over! your taste sucks!
.@dannyzuker i'm in front of the camera and behind the camera- just looked at your picture you'll never be in front of the camera!
one hit wonder @dannyzuker i notice you are not disputing all of the failures that i said you had. let's talk about it!
.@dannyzuker don't lie @apprenticenbc was #1 in all major demos at 10. do not lie!
i just sent @thegarybusey a check of $20000 for his charity children's kawasaki disease . he worked hard and deserves it.
@richardroeper keep dreaming!
@harry vickers @dannyzuker @apprenticenbc thanks!
@siegrista thanks!

obamas goal of 1 million electric car sales is a little off by over 910000 $100b of our money wasted!
our trade deficit is still on pace to be over $500b. this is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas.

@wolfrum: @goangelo remember when @realdonaldtrump was going to sue you? i can't sue him-my shirts and ties are doing great at macy's!
most people think small because most people are afraid of success afraid of making decisions afraid of winning the art of the deal
amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name f kface von clownstick like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...
whats funny about the name f kface von clownstick -- it was not coined by jon leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.
if jon stewart is so above it all & legit why did he change his name from jonathan leibowitz? he should be proud of his heritage!
jon stewart @thedailyshow is a total phony he should cherish his pastnot run from it.
as ive said many times before jon stewart @thedailyshow is highly overrated.
time magazine should name david pecker of american media to be its top guy...but they are not smart enough to do that!

i loved beating these two terrible human beings. i would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer he is a total loser!
@darjar14: @realdonaldtrump congrats mr. trump. frivolous lawsuits are a big problem in this country and issue should be addressed

sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
when it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the african american and hispanic communities. these people want law and order now!
@dblsolo700: @zed crtr @realdonaldtrump ask him about #cp5 central park 5 yea ask me about the muggers!

@go onrob the show is a joke in comparison to the original apprentice but it does pay me a lot of money.
i can't believe the yankees continue to pay a rod - they have a perfect right to stop paying and should have stopped a long time ago .

re: hiring contractors remember the cheapest isn't always the best. their work may have to be redone & they may not be reliable.
fact the reason why americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because obama refuses to pass a budget.
if fm @alexsalmond needs to litter scotland w ugly industrial wind turbines to gain independence he will lose!
if the gov't shuts down it is because obama wants to make working americans buy obamacare while businesses and gov't are exempt.
.@alexsalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down scotlands throat he's hated for it.
first minister @alexsalmond will be destroying the beauty of scotland with his insane desire for bird killing wind turbines.

@chowes247: @realdonaldtrump corzine is a evil schemer who stole 1.4 billion. trump starts a university to help people get rich & he's bad!
@susanskeldon: @realdonaldtrump i wish there were more people in the world like you. thanks for all you do. your an awesome person. thanks
@robertlbuchsr: @realdonaldtrump mr.trump i just wanted u 2 know i agree w u.respect you 2. thanks.
@bahia6085: @realdonaldtrump @chowes247 lawsuit against trump university is without a doubt ---political.
@hughphartud: schneidean is in trouble. history shows that @realdonaldtrump will publicly lambaste this guy to the point of surrender.
wow l just found out that a.g. schneiderman met with president obama in syracuse on thursday --- and sued me on saturday! same as irs etc.

gov. cuomo's moreland comm should be looking at ag schneiderman shaking down those under investigation in litigation for campaign $$$
i really enjoyed doing the show circuit this am discussing lightweight ag eric schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for ny.
amazing! ag schneiderman sues a school w a 98 approval rating but doesnt go after billion $ fraudsters all over wall st.
why isnt ag schneiderman going after democrat jon corzine and the $1.4 billion that is missing?

@elmarosuelvin thank you.
thug politics. lightweight hack schneiderman meets with obama on thursday then brings frivolous suit on saturday.
see schneiderman admit he spoke with obama about ongoing investigations.
i hope the ny tax payer appreciates the millions schneiderman is about to waste on a small case. i will litigate to victory.
@d murphy13 @realdonaldtrump purely a political move if he met w obamamr.trump please put the heat on this clown show!
@aaronpha q thanks.
@givens1964 very cool thanks.
has ag schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? we will find out.
the lightweight hack schneiderman told ivanka that the case is weak and more. meets with obama & then files one day later.
there has been a systematic targeting of the tea party by the obama administration. now schneiderman goes after me. no coincidence.

@jamieaydt: one day i hope to be successful & a bit controversial like @realdonaldtrump ...keeping things interesting & classy go for it!
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington. he doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.
i give the president's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! not bad but room for improvement!
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria. why can't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise?
that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not us.we should start rebuilding our own country & military.
@ronniedunn1164: @realdonaldtrump @hunterboss1996 a few billion more dollars but i'd rather say president trump than president gates !
@voicelikeariot : @realdonaldtrump @washingtonpost: why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid?
@janusdcjavu: @realdonaldtrump the one who talks much does nothing except make 10 billion dollars - go get a job dumbass!
@walaa 3ssaf no dopey i would not go into syria but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools.
i wonder what the great generals like patton the big m or robert e. lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria watch russia as they say in the movies shoot first and talk later!
let the arab league take care of syria. why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?
the united states needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first!

congress must protect our borders first. amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped.
what will we get for bombing syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? obama needs congressional approval.

is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria? our leaders don't know what they are doing!
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the u.s. will look very bad!
how bad has our leader made us look on syria. stay out of syria we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.
@jenconservative: @realdonaldtrump not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war!! so true!

@kingsfansouth: @realdonaldtrump i usually agree with you not tonight. stop criticizing the president. i will when he makes good decisions
@joe1spro: @realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse !
@cadams2513: @realdonaldtrump if trump was potus we would have all the money we need! #trump 2016 that's true!
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syria-big mistake if he does not!
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.amazing!
@jsdub901: @realdonaldtrump may be many things but one thing he is is right. #tellsitlikeitis thank you sort of .
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. call it the plenty of notice war
obama now just wants to save face russia is now telling him don't do it . he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us!
be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii.
@jessenicholas13: @realdonaldtrump i'm scared for my future. you should be!
@jayneg53: @realdonaldtrump can't say obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war! general patton would not be happy right now!

the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria but they want us to attack.are our leaders insane or just stupid
why isn't the arab league paying for everything and sending troops? they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
we have given syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. syria is now fully prepared!

president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line. amazingly now he denies he said that!
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement. do not attack syriafix u.s.a.

tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. make america great again!
if you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the ny times of the rebels executing prisoners you would say forget the rebels!
while everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack syria maybe we should knock the hell out of iran and their nuclear capabilities?
@gregfrech: @realdonaldtrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart & liver!!
again to our very foolish leader do not attack syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the u.s. gets nothing!
i have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant norma foerderer. she passed away yesterday a truly magnificent woman.

if president obama was going to attack syria he shouldve done it a long time ago as a surprise & not after cont
must read via @iowagop by @shanevanderhart: congress should vote no on syria
all former bush administration officials should have zero standing on syria. iraq was a waste of blood & treasure.
a 40mph gust of wind wrecked a wind turbine in scotland any turbine in close proximity to a school must go!
russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean. obamas war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict.
in january '12 3 turbines were wrecked in rough weather ...
... while a 300ft turbine in ardrossan north ayrshire erupted in flames the previous month during gales of 165 mph
if you plan for the worst if you can live with the worst the good will always take care of itself. the art of the deal
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so the arab leaguewhose members are laughing at us should pay!
@jessegunplayjay: @realdonaldtrump you're a pussy shut up and stop crying @jayleno show is funny no jay is dumb as a rock-gets outplayed
the terrorists in syria are calling themselves rebels and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid!
@jahbalon: why is sierra club not speaking up for the birds slain by turbines? must read from biologist
@khalidnasser: @realdonaldtrump in this case what would you do if you were the president? i'd rebuild the u.s. and make it great again!
@autumnallday: @realdonaldtrump i wish you'd run for office. the country needs more minds like yours. thank you.
@reallltalk: @realdonaldtrump trump for president!!! thanks.
@vindictivraider: @realdonaldtrump well quit yapping about and run for office. i like your ideas. do it!!
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what when and where to congress about a syrian attack. far too late!
we don't have the leadership including the generals who just said the element of surprise does not matter to attack anyone! cool it.
really bad news just announced concerning jobs. far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated. interest rates therefore to remain low.
i wonder how much our leaders have promised or given russia in order for them to behave and not make the u.s. look even worse?
i am not angry at russia or china because their leaders are far smarter than ours. we need real leadership and fastbefore it is too late
@robyncook7: it's sad that @realdonaldtrump knows more about politics than our politicians
remember the golden rule of negotiating: he who has the gold makes the rules. midas touch
the historic $250m renovations at @trumpdoral are moving on pace. once complete @trumpdoral will be south floridas premiere resort.
no surprise. woman being cited by kerry & mccain on syrian rebels is a paid consultant of the rebels
via @miamiherald by hannah sampson: blt prime coming to trumps doral resort
many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians. why would we ever fight with them?
obama is not a leader he's just a campaigner!
do you want to know who you are? don't ask. act! action will delineate and define you. - thomas jefferson
any political leader who wont face the future head on is putting the american dream at risk. the america we deserve
@garrygreiner: @realdonaldtrump we should send obama and congress to syria!
when we have big disasters no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping - but we are always expected to come to the aid of others!
if syria was forced to use obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired. obama should sell them that idea!
@curehdsaorg: @bretbaier huntingtons disease is a terminal and genetic illness.please retweet for education.
@bretbaier: thx rt @jedediahbila well done @bretbaier thurs cable news ratings: fox's bret baier beats cnn msnbc hln combined.
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailed-the exact ships the stealth bombers the destinations-so ridiculous!
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas! a polititian's war.
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states!
i'm a republican but not a fan of the last george bush-he also was a lousy president iraq etc. . in fact he was so bad he gave us obama!
@robertr369: @realdonaldtrump if only japan had the same courtesy dec 1941 they should have told us they were coming like us with syria!

@unabashedprog: @realdonaldtrump @thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game? actually yes!
isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks president obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there!
president obama do not attack syria. there is no upside and tremendous downside. save your powder for another and more important day!

here we go!
does he look sharp smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
doesn't want to remove assad - worries what comes next.
@bingham tammy: @realdonaldtrump why wasn't obama more concerned w benghazi #americans killed. syria not our business
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
we will have to see what russia's next move will be. they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
bottom line i don't think president changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from putin a very dangerous lifeline at that!

spitzer and weiner lost lightweight eric schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the primary. he has done a really poor job!
i said that eliot spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. i fought him when others retreated out of fear. never give up!
putin is having such a good time. our president is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. do not fearwe are a nation of potential

i hope everybody reads the @amspec article shakedown schneiderman the ag of new york @agschneiderman
#trumpvine on obamacare website-
@officialmelb & @thomasaroberts are hosting trump @missuniverse 2013 pageant in moscow. they will be terrific!
sen. @davidvitter & @david bossie w @seanhannity demand 'congress live by your laws'
hitting at home. democrat sen. joe donnellys son had his healthcare plan dropped
revisionist history. now obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans. crazy!
the @erictrumpfdn event featured a performance by #celebapprentice @johnrich- a great event for a great cause! watch-
not only does obama spy on german leaders he criticizes their trade surplus we should have a trade surplus!
can you believe that the builder of the failed obamacare website was just given a new government contract - how stupid is that - clueless!!!
the truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price - everyone in u.s. would benefit!
our nobel prize for peace president said i'm really good at killing people according to just out book double down. can oslo retract prize?
@jvince81: @bforrealstevens govchristie @realdonaldtrump that tie is awesome. i need that tie. where can i get it? macy's
@mzulianix3: @realdonaldtrump you are the coolest man i've ever met thank you!

success tip: see yourself as victorious. this will focus you in the right direction. apply your skills and talent--and be tenacious.
job tip: if you were the employer what kind of person would you most desire as an employee? be that person.
use your intelligence and your education to execute what your imagination presents to you. this is one step to becoming an entrepreneur.
brian @kilmeade wrote a wonderful book called george washington's secret six that is truly worth reading.
@hitthelights 14: @realdonaldtrump can't wait for 2016!!!! america needs you!!!!#trump2016 thank you what a mess our country is in.
when obama tried to tweak his previous statement on obamacare he made it an even greater lie-even the senate democrats are angry with him!
just sit back and watch obamacare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. the website is the best part of this mess!
she is so sad and pathetic that i almost feel sorry for sec.sebelius. she has done great harm to many people and must be fired. incompetent!
put kathleen sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say you're fired! let her go home to her family and rest. bring in top flight people!
prediction: the disaster known as obamacare will only get worse and republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years!
a level will be reached where obamacare will be so out of control expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship.
if democrats do not start opposing obamacare and fast republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 - far greater than any predictions!
i will be going to asheville north carolina tonight for the 95th birthday party of the great billy graham - such a wonderful man!

upstate new york needs jobs. frack now & frack fast! pay off ny state debt.
read the bible. work hard and honestly. and don't complain. rev. @billygraham
dont toss off your problems and dont dwell on them either. deal with them! think like a champion
the obamacare disaster will increase the amount of uninsured what is the point of this trillion $ monstrosity?
success tip: be ready for problems and be patient--there are very few cases of instant gratification.
being successful requires nothing less than 100 of your concentrated effort. be totally focused.
leadership: whatever happens you're responsible. if it doesn't happen you're responsible.

i will be on fox & friends tomorrow morning at 7.
remember that i predicted a long time ago that president obama will attack iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!
@brahsumatra: @realdonaldtrump remember when you use to have real hair? spelling - i still do dummy it is all mine!
if we could force russia china and other competitors to use obamacare we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success!
drew brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!
if justice roberts had done the right thing and voted against obamacare our country would be in a lot better shape right now! total turmoil
@joeyb134: i hope @realdonaldtrump will invite me to golf with him @trumpdoral when it is all complete. it looks like an awesome place
@el juino: @realdonaldtrump well i will predict that if u run for president you will win
the republicans must be patient and smart - obamacare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible!
while i was in moscow i see that president obsma apologized for his lie i mean statement on obamacare! how nice of him to be so forthright
@ maleki : @realdonaldtrump : give the people what they want and announce your candidacy for president 2016. thank you very nice.

@shrubshrub: i've said it before. i'll say it again. the turn down service at the @trumptoronto is the best in the world. thank you!
@dcooldog: after careful consideration i'm going with my blue @realdonaldtrump #signaturecollection tie for my big meeting today. do well
president obama is under pressure from democrats to undo his lie on obamacare. his problem is that such a move would end obamacare.
obamacare is on life support - it will soon be dead on arrival - a bad concept that was imcompetently administered!
no matter how far down a path you go if it's the wrong path turn around and go back home - before it is too late.
can you believe itthe model who mysteriously disappeared from the obamacare website is not a us citizenshes from colombia.
the same people that built the obamacare website used as the face of the website someone who is not a us citizen. incompetent.

i wonder what the late great vince lombardi would say about the rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled?
football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatoryracist and can be viewed as bullying
i wonder if the rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?
@marloamoriello1: @realdonaldtrump donald we can't allow this country to become soft like obama and penn state! please run in 2016 #leader
the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign and be sued for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
maybe some of the dead voters who helped get president obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for obamacare.
how did the ncaa which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from penn state. others zero!

knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. we better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!
if you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged and you carry a gun shoot the bastard teach them a lesson !
weak newscasters are asking is there a racial component to knockout attacks? of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!
for all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack please remember the late great charles bronson-no more crime!

hypocrite. watch senator obama defend democratic debate' of senate filibuster rules in 2005
since the democrats decided to kill the filibuster they now own it.republicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority.
thomas jefferson wrote the senate filibuster rule. harry reid & obama killed it yesterday. rule was in effect for over 200 years.
such a nice article in the new york times about a wonderful developer arthur zeckendorf

we are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the iran nuclear talks. strengthen sanctions until great deal is made!

how much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent leader - obamacare iran syria bads deals. just never ends

tom brady is a good friend of mine a great player a great guy and a total winner! fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs!
john kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with iran. great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one
the reason great dealmakers do not openly celebrate a deal especially one that is not complete is that it shows weakness to the other side
i know it has been many years since our country made great deals but isn't it about time we start right now. make america great again!
best book ever on dealmaking or so they say - trump: the art of the deal. go get it and others washington - you really can do better!
after settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars j.p.morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine-why did they settle then-dumb!
don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact and focus on the positives.
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. you're in charge. everything starts with you.
who would you rather have negotiating with iran--president obama or toronto mayor ford? my money is on ford.
obama is going to take away over 90m americans healthcare plans but he is letting iran keep its nukes. just think about that.
why didn't obama as part of the negotiation free the christian pastor saeed abedini?
the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. the art of the deal.
just got home watching the news and every story is bad about the u.s. someday we will return to being great again but we need leadership!
don't worry the united states will be great again!

how does obama rationalize giving iran $8b in sanction relief when a christian pastor is being tortured in an iranian prison?
look great for thanksgiving. trump signature collection exclusively available @macys offers top men's styles
set the example. you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.
look at the solution not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results.
president obama said over and over again if you like your plan you can keep your plan period! this turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.

tell iran to let our christian pastor go--and i mean right now. if they don't there will be hell to pay.
happy thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!
us froze $8b in iranian assets during 79 hostage crisis. now obama is giving it back to iran while christian pastor is jailed. don't do it!
why doesn't president obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie announce that obamacare was a mistake and deal a really great plan!
despite the fact that i have had great success with the words you're fired i do not like firing people. but zero on obamacare mess-no way!
can you believe that president karzai of afghanistan is holding out for more more more and refuses to sign deal. tell him to go to hell!

#1. keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities and possibilities and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
#2. keep your momentum. without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
#3. look at the solution not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results.
@bigboblarsen i don't always agree with you but i must say you do know how to inspire... thank you.
@zootmantom @realdonaldtrump love your words of wisdom. merry christmas & happy new year thanks.
@tseay18 find work that you love--you have to be passionate about it to succeed. then focus and never give up!
entrepreneurs: be ready for problems--you'll have them every day. keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins.
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. you're in charge--everything starts with you.
did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster. never look back just learn from your experience!
sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make!
always try to learn from other peoples mistakes not your own - it is much cheaper that way!

@sneal50 the best thing you win by winning usa universe is the opportunity to learn from @realdonaldtrump ..... thank you.
entrepreneurs: apply your skills and talent but above all be tenacious. see yourself as victorious--which means never giving up.
entrepreneurs: whatever happens you're responsible. if it doesn't happen you're responsible.
entrepreneurs: put everything you've got into what you're doing. be totally focused--nothing should be haphazard.
i'd like to wish all of my friends--and even my many enemies--a very merry christmas and happy new year.

we're coming up on the new year-it is really important that despite so many stupid decisions being made in washington we make it best ever

be tough be focused. there are a lot of ups and downs but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them.
ask yourself is this a blip or is it a catastrophe? and your equilibrium will be kept in check if when hard times hit.
cover your bases--know everything you can about what you're doing. keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis.

thinking big is the driving force that has forged all the great achievements in modern life. - think big
it's jan. 2. president obama should end his vacation early & get back to washington to straighten out the obamacare catastrophe--or end it.
snowden should come back to america and face justice. instead he is begging for clemency from moscow. treat him as a spy.

entrepreneurs: set the example and you'll be a magnet for the right people. great leaders determine the teams they assemble.
have your own vision & stick with it. don't be afraid to be unique.every day is an opportunity to show what you can do at the highest level.

plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries which are highly combustible as cargo. fire could have started in cockpit.
lithium ion batteries should not be allowed to be used in aircraft. i won't fly on the boeing 787 dreamliner - it uses those batteries.

failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently. -- henry ford
president obama was able to fool the americans by getting elected but not able to fool vladimir putin. too bad for us!
we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers and that's ok-but how much are russia & china spending?
i don't hate obama at all i just think he is an absolutely terrible president maybe the worst in our history!
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world president obama is watching march madness basketball !
president obama be cool be smart be sharp and focus no more march madness and you can beat putin at his own game. it can be done!

putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity. obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. sad
i believe putin will continue to re-build the russian empire. he has zero respect for obama or the u.s.!
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. must be very strong to prosper & survive
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to world war iii. we need great leadership fast
obama must now focus get his mind off march.madness and lead! watch russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare!
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone. i hear they will be doing it soonlong overdue.
obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off air force one. doesnt look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.

he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else. -- benjamin franklin
president obama looks absolutely exhausted in the netherlands. he is not a natural leader was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc.
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness!
@wesbart53: watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. carter-esque weak. his delivery is so cautious not to offend absolutely zero true!
by obama mentioning manhattan yesterday in his response he has singlehandedly made it target #1. how totally stupid is this guy?
if youve looked over the yearsive been right on virtually every issue from iraq not going in but if so taking the oil to jobs to china

@ctsa: @realdonaldtrump when i was a kid there were 8. now they give upwards of 31-40. it's an assault on the immune system.
if i were president i would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - autism.

@mrcurvywor @realdonaldtrump enjoyed seeing you on @letterman! you should run for president! you would get this great country going again!
that the obama administration didn't know the facts about who bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!
only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for bergdahl. #orangeroom
bowe bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. solders died looking for him. u.s. should never have made the deal! punishment?
@ralphige: who knew al qaeda had such good negotiators. impressive 5 for 1 against the mighty usa @realdonaldtrump
@taylor mcbath obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world. we are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions
great deal we swap 5 killer terrorists for a u.s. military deserter. thats how the u.s. negotiates nowadays.
president said we would never leave a soldier behind. how about the 4 who died in benghazi?
because of our terrible leaders it is now open season on every american throughout the world. terrorists are thrilled.
be sure to buy this months @amspec magazine. read a trump card my interview with jeffrey lord.
obamas war on coal is killing american jobs making us more energy dependent on our enemies & creating a great business disadvantage.

@lisav27 @realdonaldtrump i want you mr. trump as the president well we'd better get someone fast--the u.s. is going down--fast.
moving forward f tonights competitive primaries it is crucial that the tea party & @gop remain united towards november. take the senate!
it would be nice if our commander-in-chief was as concerned for our veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens.
the problem is that no government can create real jobs. only entrepreneurs can do that. midas touch
remember our six brave heroes who died searching for bergdahl after he deserted h t @military news
the entrepreneurs ability to dream to win lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit. midas touch
our president is a great embarrassment to the u.s. how could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap?
the five taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. they are saying how dumb u.s. is!
@wolf hausmann: what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. --donald trump
rapidly failing @vanityfair magazine hits me for my strong stance against obama's brilliant 5 killers for 1 deserter trade. amazing!
@tquoteseday: if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure stop! instead make your work more pleasurable. - donald trump
.@newsbusters thank you for a great and very accurate story - well done!
was susan rice told to lie about bergdahl? obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything from obamacare to a deserter.
are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?
obama never consulted with congress about a prisoner exchange. he broke the law and should be tried. our president is a total disaster!
chris mcdaniel looks like he will win in mississippi - great news and big victory for tea party!

obama betrays israel yet again our strongest ally in the middle east. he will recognize hamas breaking long standing us policy.
obama can release 5 senior taliban for a deserter but cant make mexico release decorated marine sgt. andrew tahmooressi. pathetic

@elchucacabra: @realdonaldtrump obama can strike a deal with the taliban but can't make a deal with congress.

iran is moving troops into iraq under the guise that it is helping out. actually they will take over iraq and all of their oil. stupid u.s.
turnberry in scotland is a far superior golf course to pinehurst - and it isn't even close! likewise the blue monster at doral.
iran will convince our incompetent president that they are trying to help us with iraq take over the country & oil and o will say thanks
i have been very consistent and always said that iraq would fall as soon as the u.s. left. what a terrible waste of lives and money!

.@mattginellagc matt the statement about pinehurst looking like a local community golf course awful was not made by me but tweeted to me
@dcolon2112: @raw1183 it was my comment not @realdonaldtrump i've played on nicer par 3 courses than #usopen
.@mattginellagc have you ever seen trump national bedminster or trump international golf links in scotland. both far better than pinehurst!
@christianl2499: @realdonaldtrump you're the man mr. trump! #donaldtrump2016 thanks.
@pgongola: @realdonaldtrump @mattginellagc i think pinehurst is ugly.

@golfdigestmag big news from scotland on turnberry which by the way blows pinehurst away! tomorrow morning. stay tuned.
@jshamie: @golfdigestmag couldn't agree more. the course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would. boring finish!!!
@timgerzabek: @realdonaldtrump @golfdigestmag i thought this was the us open not the wanna be british open
@markmoreland: it's worse for @pinehurstresort. i know i wouldn't pay $400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course.
@epowell88: worked @ restaurant for 33 yrs & got fired because they didn't think i could keep up. no severance! would u do that? no way!
@mommom: just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass. you gave him a reward....good job donald! thanks
@foossh:@golfdigestmag @realdonaldtrump he has a point fairways should be green. scruff can be as bad as you want. wouldn't pay top dollar
i'd bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. this is not what golf is about!
@robert w ga: @realdonaldtrump they think the course should be old school you know like before lawn care technology aka goats!
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump please don't let the usga ruin your course in 2017 like they did pinehurst. i won't!
@jackhennessy12: @realdonaldtrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg? true!
@mikeyy84: @realdonaldtrump very subdue atmosphere. not take it away from kaymer but it's like watching paint dry #usopen #anticlimax
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst. said they should be redone
@mattginellagc my position on pinehurst is correct - bad for the game a dried out cow pasture. you have no clue but keep trying!
@mattginellagc i have watched open championships at turnberry one of the great golf courses of the world. pinehurst not in the same league
@mattginellagcsadly matt you don't understand golf even though you think you do .i have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump i've played pinehurst and trump bedminster and donald has 2 in bedminister that are superior. thank you & true
@clarksmidt: sir donald. rather than promote golf courses please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our country.

@vmisciagna: @realdonaldtrump i've played the new doral which is awesome-one day i hope to play another trump course
@gunnandrew: @realdonaldtrump future british open? #trumpscotland
@charliemaikis: @realdonaldtrump i completely agree with dt here. pinehurst looks bad. i wouldn't pay $400 to play if it looked like that.
@rink914: @ianjamespoulter actually agree...it may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on tv..i love golf..couldn't watch
@mattginellagc matt you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. you are all talk no substance!
@g3stover: @mattginellagc is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with @realdonaldtrump i can beat him in golf even easier!

@mattginellagc matt how many club championships have you won? i hear zero or 18 fewer than me! lets play for a lot?
@welsh @realdonaldtrump you have made some great courses but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course! i agree!
@ichicagoscott: @realdonaldtrump it was nice of you to give @mattginellagc 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had. i agree!
@tedataca: i concur with @realdonaldtrump on pinehurst. imo: those blasts from sandy areas looked like ieds exploding in kandahar province.

obama claims that he needs an extra $4b to secure the border. well then he should not have wasted $5b on the obamacare website.
if obama is concerned about the border he should stop vacationing. gov't will save millions which it can use to stop illegal migration.
you can always become better. - @tigerwoods

can you believe that president obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the u.s. from west africa. terrible president!
if ebola is so non-contagious how come an nbc cameraman caught it so quickly while over in west africa? u.s. is behaving very foolishly!
@intheelections: @realdonaldtrump my advice: run for president!
this ebola patient thomas duncan who fraudulently entered the u.s. by signing false papers is causing havoc. if he lives prosecute!
something very important and indeed society changing may come out of the ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: no shaking hands!
@fredsmith433: @realdonaldtrump please run for president
president obama - close down the flights from ebola infected areas right now before it is too late! what the hell is wrong with you?
president obama i have an idea! pretend that west africa is israel and then you will be able to stop the ebola area flights.

fact amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
isis is starting its own currency. may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented.
iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal. iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! not smart.

@therealzach49: this is why we need @realdonaldtrump in office. @barackobama doesn't know how to keep order
despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.if obama were a leader this would not be the case
if the decision by the grand jury in ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now!
can you imagine what putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the u.s. as they watch the ferguson riot
as china and the rest of the world continue to rip off the u.s. economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in ferguson!
sadly because president obama has done such a poor job as president you won't see another black president for generations!
our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in washington you can expect ferguson type riots and looting in other places
who is the moron who decided to release the ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. what were they thinking?
if you love it own it. @trumpcondoslv bring unparalleled style elegance and world class amenities to las vegas
president obama has absolutely no control or respect over the african american community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency.

just as i predicted @rosie would fail on the view-
ratings way down show irrelevant. why haven't they learned? @rosie always fails.
rosie odonnell went after me again on the view in order to stir up her failing ratings. nothing will help her--@rosie always fails.
#trumpvlog @rosie needs to rest and relax. it's not working.
#trumpvlog @rosie wasn't even a short term fix at the view.
congratulations to @nycparks on quickly repairing the lasker rink. record skaters this past thanksgiving!
.@whoopigoldberg dont let @rosie speak badly of you or try to bring you down. she is rude crude & not smart. she is not in your league.

if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure stop trying to balance them. instead make your work more pleasurable.
without passion you don't have energy without energy you have nothing. find work that you love and the energy will be there.
in the end you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
@brettneveraski: i see you @realdonaldtrump

@jpnwrites the oscars can learn a lot from the miss universe pageant. @realdonaldtrump true!
i told you the oscars were terriblebad look bad talentand among the lowest ratings in shows history.
the talks between the u.s. and iran are going on forever world's longest negotiation. obama has no idea what he is doing - incompetent!
the oscars were a great night for mexico & why notthey are ripping off the us more than almost any other nation.
i have a lawsuit in mexicos corrupt court system that i won but so far cant collect. dont do business with mexico!
the @huffingtonpost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism as is gross arianna huffington. they dont report the facts!
i told everybody the oscars were no goodnielsen ratings confirmed one of the lowest ratings in history.
put the glamour beauty & mystery back in the oscars and the ratings will zoom. also & most importantly the oscars need credibility.
i could fix tv talk shows that are doing poorlythere is tremendous talent out there waiting to be tappedand nobody sees it!
the evening news broadcasts must stop talking about weatherboring and too many other topics.

.@jonahnro you stated that i started relentlessly tweeting like a 14-year-old girl... horrible insult to women. resign now or later!
people have been forced to resign positions for far less than @jonahnros tweeting like a 14 year old girl
with a stupid guy like jonah goldberg who uses tweeting like a 14 year old girl to hit me no wonder the nro is doing so poorly. @jonahnro
im a conservative but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other whereas liberals unite to win.
the reason ed schultz said nice things about me is that im the only repub who won't cut social security etc. ill make america rich again!

i want to negotiate my own and much better trade deals for our country. must include currency manipulation and more . do not let pass!
no amnesty. protect the rule of law! lets make america great again
the trans-pacific partnership is an attack on america's business. it does not stop japan's currency manipulation. this is a bad deal.
republicans should not be giving obama fast track authority on trade. the trans-pacific partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
the trans-pacific partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. do not pass it.
china has a backdoor into the trans-pacific partnership. this deal does not address currency manipulation. china is laughing at us.

wow 15 policemen hurt in baltimore some badly! where is the national guard. police must get tough and fast! thugs must be stopped.
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch. should be a lesson on how not to handle riots. sad!
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore!
now that the ineffective baltimore police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the u.s. taxpayers expected to rebuild it again ?
the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy - another real genius!
@vanderpunked: can we drop @realdonaldtrump off in the middle of #baltimore so he can show obama how it's done? i would fix it fast!
our country has to come together. we have to start working with and really liking each other. the whole world is watching baltimore.
president obama you have a big job to do. go to baltimore and bring both sides together. with proper leadership it can be done! do it.
the best social program by far is a job! our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries - incompetent leader.
hopefully there won't be any problems in baltimore tonight. be calm be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.there is just too much to live for!
i wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the united states as they watch the disgusting and out of control baltimore riots?
@jtruelove713: if @realdonaldtrump runs for president i will vote for the first time ever. until then...........
@lynuscantwell: the world is laughing. obama is a joke. no hillary the sequel. run donald please. we need no nonsense leadership.

if the working proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views the u.s. as we know it is doomed!

stop saying i went bankrupt. i never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantagesmart!
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. its a very effective & commonly used business tool.

univision wants to back out of signed @missuniverse contract because i exposed the terrible trade deals that the u.s. makes with mexico.
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them. really bad for us jobs only good for mexico.
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down. jeb pushed him hard! remember!
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott @univision.
.@univision cares far more about mexico than it does about the u.s. are they controlled by the mexican government?
if i win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bush's appointee john roberts on obamacare.
letter to @univision - re: @trumpdoral

now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the u.s. comes over border!
.....but that's what i've been saying. very unfair treatment by the media!
the u.s. will invite el chapo the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a u.s. citizen because our leaders can't say no!
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the u.s.
....likewise billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border. we get the killers drugs & crime they get the money!
when will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement mexico is sending.... which turned out to be true? el chapo

i am now in iowa getting ready to speak. people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant presbyterian . great.
statement on john mccain-
just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. i will be back soon.
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president!
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes!
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
....john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives.
all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything.
i will make this right for our great vets!
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans.....
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans. veterans deserve universal access to care. va scandal proves politicians are inept.
congrats to the new gov. of texas @gregabbott tx for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. should have been done long ago by perry.

@mwood 79: @sharylattkisson why do they attack mr trump? because he has something they dont. the ability of truth! trump is here!
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix. he owes apology!
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk.
a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday
the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times!
i will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous energy! make america great again
my @usatopinion piece: trump: i don't need to be lectured
@hl3tweets: mccain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our $19 trillion train-wreck including the va debacle.
@pg rant: they can't handle you donald so want you out the race well good luckbecause we know you won't walk away! give it to them
@2014 vince: the left wing politically correct cannot handle big don giving the truth....reality....keep saying it like it is !!!!

the ever dwindling @wsj which is worth about 1 10 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically. who cares!
we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
@johnjcarp61 at least we're talking about the #va! we weren't a month ago! @realdonaldtrump @johnmccain
@vetapologist this is big criticism of the republican field. speak truth and stop being so pc. this is why @realdonaldtrump resonates!
@danscavino @realdonaldtrump hosts events around the #usa 4our #veterans. long before a presidential run. he loves our military.
@ eod i believe we have passed that point. there are homeless veterans in usa & yet illegal aliens get government housing
@rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
@mjjustus1 @andrewstilesusa @realdonaldtrump trump already hosts vets at his resorts. what does hillary do?

@linflies @ghostdancer 2 @contrarian11 @michaelcohen212 @chriscuomo @deptvetaffairs ...rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done
@amit @realdonaldtrump i agree 100 . mccain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets.
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldn't do the apprentice that they became upset w me. they couldnt care less about inclusion
this story is no longer about john mccain its about our horribly treated vets. illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.
look how small the pages have become @wsj. looks like a tabloidsaving money i assume!
i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc.

@abcpolitics must apologize. my statement we're going to get them out so fast so quick applied to hard core criminals & gang members. lie
.@tomllamasabc cannot report the news truthfully. why not apologize for your fraudulent story on world news tonight.gang members & criminals
@mattyjack33: @tomllamasabc so refreshing to have someone call out these left wingers posing as journalists. keep it up trump!
@2ndvoter: @stevehuang68 agree. one of the things that is good abt @realdonaldtrump is he's forcing others out of status quo politicking.
we are going to make our country so strong again so great again. no more ripping off the united states. we will make america great again!
alabama will shine tomorrow. it will be a big and glorious day!
jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies offensive. now he wants to use it because i use it. stay true to yourself!
how crazy - 7.5 of all births in u.s. are to illegal immigrants over 300000 babies per year. this must stop. unaffordable and not right!

alabama was great last night amazing people. 30000 folks was largest crowd of political season. nice!
@crstin0516: @danscavino @keraladubai @realdonaldtrump that chant gave me sweet sweet chills!! #usa #america
@dojiedojie: @realdonaldtrump keep talking donald....the people want to hear it loud and clear!!!!!
.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source and that is saying something. they go out of their way to distort truth!
i had 15000 people in phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000. but said bernie sanders had 11000 in same room.
thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night. it was a great evening!
how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? very sad!
it has just been confirmed by the city of mobile alabama that there were 30000 people at last nights event making it #1for pol season.
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally speaking up. just politicians!
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing.
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. jeb just can't get it right!
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house. would be the same old thing remember read my lips no more taxes . greatness!
new reuters poll just came out and has me at 32 highest number yet.the silent majority is back and we will make america great again!
as i have long stated we are so tied in with china and asia that their markets are now taking the u.s. market down. get smart u.s.a.
@john franco: when people start losing their savings & home value they will be begging trump to fix the economy #makeamericagreatagain
markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing china and asia to dictate the agenda. this could get very messy! vote trump.
@zephyrusmatrix: will you finally get respect for predicting u.s. concerns even weeks before disaster strikes.the country needs a visionary
@glendabelle 11 @foxnewsinsider @foxandfriends @realdonaldtrump trump supporters- volunteer contribute assist campaign etc .we need trump
@sweetspottrader: only @realdonaldtrump can save us form this turmoil #trump2016 perhaps so!

@jerihyatt: @megynkelly @jebbush @realdonaldtrump pffffffttttt we need to do something about illegals who get more than our vets!!!!!
.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation she is really off her game. was afraid to confront dr. cornel west. no clue on immigration!
i liked the kelly file much better without @megynkelly. perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
@colehudson68: @megynkelly @foxnews @theblaze @greta @oreillyfactor megyn needs to go back on vacation. what a waste of an hour on fox.
@bigpaulfla: @realdonaldtrump she has come back looking like nancy grace
@swamp bug: @seanhannity cruz is my second third choice. carson is also a good man. i look at it as war so my choice is trump.

@barbavh: @realdonaldtrump @megynkelly ordered my trump banner today. can't wait!
@youngyoung54: @jerihyatt @megynkelly @jebbush so true. jeb bush is crazy who cares that he speaks mexican this is america english !!
@patrickstinard: @megynkelly kelly file was much better without megyn kelly. her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better!
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc. is he ashamed of the name bush? a pretty sad situation. go jeb!
in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. a mess!
jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence. it's not a fence jeb it's a wall and there's a big difference!
.@governorpataki did a terrible job as governor of new york. if he ran again he would have lost in a landslide. he and graham zero in polls
@ibemoshing: no hope for jeb bush anymore @realdonaldtrump has been on fire! really hope he can get the win and fix this country!
@dlund22226523: gov. scott walker has ran wisconsin's economy into the ground. how dare he criticize you. you would fire him in a second.
@ragefelix: @governorpataki ... i lived in ny when tacky pataki was gov... he was a total disaster for the people of new york
@asa patriot: @realdonaldtrump @patrickstinard @megynkelly i could not agree more ! i now flip to other channels at 9:00pm
@linda lcarson: @realdonaldtrump rubio and bush cant say wall. i guess it is not pc. just like obama cant say islamic terrorists !!
congrats @lindseygrahamsc. you just got 4 points in your home state of scfar better than zero nationally. youre only 26 pts behind me.
another good poll result in the great state of sc. trump at 30 . carson at 15 and bush at 9 .

president obama wants to change the name of mt. mckinley to denali after more than 100 years. great insult to ohio. i will change back!

yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. will jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
jeb is spending millions of dollars on hit ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. bad system.
while millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates. i am self funding.
congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on twitter--and heading up fast!
no more clintons or bushes!
many super pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to attack trump. remember when u see them
im turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributionsfeel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
why does @oreillyfactor and @foxnews always have karl rove on. he spent $430 million and lost all races. a dope who said romney won election
every poll has me winning big.if you listen to dopey karl rove a trump hater on @oreillyfactor you would think i'm doing poorly. @foxnews

when i intelligently turned down the club for growth crazy request for $1000000 they got nasty.what a waste of money that would have been
@patrick0215: @thatsalrighty @oreillyfactor @foxnews @karlrove rove is suffering from @jebbush defeatism. #makeamericagreatagain

the dallas event in two weeks at the american airlines center is filling up fast. get your tickets fast before it is too late!
very low ratings radio host hugh hewitt asked me about suleiman abu bake al-baghdad hassan nasrallah and more - typical gotcha questions
why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like hugh hewitt be doing the next debate on @cnn. he is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy!
just announced that because of trump advertising rates for debate on @cnn are going from $5000 to $200000 a 4000 increase.pay charity?
saudi arabia was vehemently against the iran nuclear deal. then today they embraced it. what happened? what did we give them to endorse?
hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen. in fact it wasn't even see through glass it was black
hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion no truth. just can't read speeches!
remember that i am self-funding my campaign. hillary jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100 controlled
by self-funding my campaign i am not controlled by my donors special interests or lobbyists. i am only working for the people of the u.s.!
the hedge fund guys gals have to pay higher taxes asap. they are paying practically nothing. we must reduce taxes for the middle class!

@tropic20: @realdonaldtrump do you see what's in tom brady's locker?
the phony club for growth which asked me in writing for $1000000 i said no is now wanting to do negative ads on me. total hypocrites!
our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision not someone like hillary or barack neither of which has a clue!
the dallas event on september 14 at 6:00 p.m. at the american airlines center looks like it will be a giant success. tickets are going fast!
i will be in washington d.c. on wednesday1 p.m.in front of the capitol to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with iran.

trumps campaign hat becomes an ironic summer accessory - the new york times.
donald trump sends @fallontonight to highest friday rating in 18 months. @jimmyfallon that is #huge!
lightweight senator @randpaul should focus on trying to get elected in kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.
i truly understood the appeal of ron paul but his son @randpaul didn't get the right gene.
too many people on stage for debate. @randpaul at 11th with 2 in @realclearnews shouldn't be allowed to participate.
i am having a great time in iowa at jack trice stadium! unbelievable people.
had a record crowd in boone iowa. a fantastic day--- we will #makeamericagreatagain

wow great post-debate poll: trump increases lead via breitbart
give america back its dream! -- donald j. trump
thank you.
ive just released my position papers on the second amendment.
looking forward to meeting the students of urbandale high school tomorrow-
am i morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? i don't think so!
this is the first time in my life that i have caused controversy by not saying something.
if someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue? no chance!
if i would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. a no win situation!
christians need support in our country and around the world their religious liberty is at stake! obama has been horrible i will be great
on my way to iowa. will be landing in des moines in two hours. see ya!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016

@moehoward86: the best interview thus far...keep it up trump! donald trump: enough with the nice! via @youtube
@leghanliptak712: cnn tried to destroy donald trump with vaccine autism question but he gave this amazing response
i will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. based on the debate results i should do well-who knows?
there is no way that carly fiorina can become the republican nominee or win against the dems. boxer killed her for senate in california!
i have been leading big in all polls with two more today @nbc and @cnn. the nbc poll is more than double next at 29 . fiorina has 11 .
i am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far. much of the media is totally dishonest. so sad!
we are going to win and make america great again maybe better than ever before!
carly fiorina did such a horrible job at lucent and hp virtually destroying both companies that she never got another ceo job offer! pres.
@saijosaijo75: @realdonaldtrump thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again!
will be on @foxandfriends now. enjoy!
the @todayshow refused to use their just in poll numbers where i have a massive lead but instead used @cnn numbers where my lead is smaller.
@mntwisterchaser: thanks @savannahguthrie and @nbcnews for showing us how lopsided you are! use your own poll! #trainwreck #trump2016
@paulkdebra: @todayshow @realdonaldtrump i totally support you! you have this ga. girl's vote!!!
@thebrodyfile: on the muslim issue: it might help @barackobama if he didn't take five years to visit israel
@thebrodyfile: on the muslim issue: it might help @barackobama if he actually supported christians religious liberty rights.
@nunyabus1: @realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends you go trumpy don't back down i won't.
@johnste38475254: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews ...why is fox being so hard on u? i don't get it...are they idiots?
@dis labeledvet: @realdonaldtrump here is a clinton insider who admitted hillary started the whole obama's a muslim
@talsept58: @realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends you are great!!
@mickelsenkyle: @todayshow could you make your interview with @realdonaldtrump any more biased or... #trumpforpresident
@linley4067 jane: @realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends fox is using you for ratings. they want u out of the race. refuse.
@alivelutheran: @todayshow touts cnn polls instead of their own!! of course the nbc one shows him much higher. trump corrects them!
new zogby poll highly respected but the media wont report it because it gives me an even bigger lead!
#asktrump send me your questions to answer live from @twitternyc later this afternoon.
carly fiorina is terrible at business--the last thing our country needs!
jeb has been confused for forty years-

.@oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including nbc. @foxnews not good for me!
.@oreillyfactor why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old trump haters. boring!
@ragingcynicism: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor they're not trump haters. they're spoon fed morons.

@diannrr: @megynkelly do you dream about @realdonaldtrump? he's in your head. let it go. she is the worst - all anti-trump! terrible show.
@john dipaolo: @realdonaldtrump will get out disaffected repub base voters as well as democrats looking for a real choice on immigration.
i am having a really hard time watching @foxnews.
.@richlowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking heads - he doesn't have a clue!
@ellenespence: @marklevinshow thank you for maintaining your integrity during this disgusting lynching of @realdonaldtrump thanks mark!
@waynearmstron10: @realdonaldtrump you must be relentless and maintain energy and respond as you have been. it's a marathon. true.
@phyllisa: @hopeisalive66 @jdanielmoore @theblaze @megynkelly @realdonaldtrump that's ok! the more they talk the better potus trump looks!
@joeoh89: @seanhannity @realdonaldtrump what happened to the pledge? walker quits and slams trump. losers proving pledge was sham.
@themindwave: @foxnews im not sure why u r giving them this much importance they had wanted to take u down in debate and they failed!!
@seleti00: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews they attack you more then cnn or msnbc combined. just a bunch of old bush appointee rhinos.

@edwardchelednik: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews hey donald your not alone. i can't watch it at all. used to be all i watched.
@glendabelle 11: @foxnews fox has become a supporter of liberals!they are not supporting the gop candidates-especially trump! quit watching
@jimclarkfarrier: @rockprincess818 @leahr77 @realdonaldtrump is the only one who can get us out of this mess! true!
@miriamrosemc: #trump2016 would be the best for the country jobs trade and taxes - all others are status quo #makeamericagreatagain

i will be on the @colbertlateshow tonight at 11:30
senator marco amnesty rubio who has worst voting record in senate just hit me on national security-but i said don't go into iraq. vision
do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when i hit back it is totally sexist. she is highly overrated!
i think @megynkelly should take another eleven day unscheduled vacation.
just remember the birther movement was started by hillary clinton in 2008. she was all in!
i will be the featured guest on the season opener of @60minutes this sunday. there certainly is plenty to talk about!
i will be doing @colbertlateshow at 11:30 on cbs. enjoy!
@mark60644: @megynkelly still cannot figure out this massive base of support for trump is because he is anti- politician. #trump2016
.@juliinkster congratulations on your great win--what a captain what a champion!
headline reads rubio passes bush in florida poll -- unfair because trump destroys them both! trump 31.5 rubio 19.2 bush 11.3
yogi berra was not only a great baseball player he was a great guy. yogi will be missed.
.@foxnews has been treating me very unfairly & i have therefore decided that i won't be doing any more fox shows for the foreseeable future.
wow! what a great night. thank you to all of the viewers and congratulations to @stephenathome @colbertlateshow
incompetent @richlowry lost it tonight on @foxnews. he should not be allowed on tv and the fcc should fine him!
.@foxnews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @richlowry to use such foul language on tv. unheard of!
will be on @cnn at 7:00 a.m.
will be on @morning joe at 6:30 a.m.
so happy about my daughter @ivankatrumps announcement that she will be having a baby this spring. congratulations!

despite the establishment and the medias best efforts the people are speaking loudly and clearly. thank you to my amazing supporters!
bloomberg: trump leads gop field
dishonest @nytimes reporter jonathan martin refused to acknowledge massive crowd surge forward
.@politico which is not read or respected by many may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.
the failing @politico news outlet which i hear is losing lots of money is really dishonest!
wow a really nice lead in new hampshire--- an increase since my last poll!
@yayala19: @politico when the other candidates are talking politics trump is talking solutions. he is the most talented candidate.
just watched @marcorubio on television. just another all talk no action politician. truly doesn't have a clue! worst voting record in sen.
@yayala19: @marcorubio what the lobbyists the media and career politicians will do next to try to stop trump? silent majority is back
@joemarzocco: @realdonaldtrump they attack trump for not giving policy is the most important detail he wins.
.@megynkelly the @foxnews poll said very plainly i came in second in the debate. all others time drudge slate etc. said i came in 1st.
@rketeltas: @joemarzocco waiting for the biased media to write about the 30000 carly fired as a failed ceo. america is for trump!
great reception in d.c. at the values voter summit. now checking on my job at the old post office...
.....ahead of schedule and under budget! will be in oklahoma tonight!

lightweight senator marco rubio is very weak on immigration knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals!
@taurus82409: @cbs @60minutes look forward to it donald. you are doing great! please keep up the fight many of us are behind you 100 !!
@karentalk: @rogerjstonejr @megynkelly fiorina is not surging..she is begging for money..and she owns this.
marco rubio is a member of the gang of eight or very weak on stopping illegal immigration. only changed when poll numbers crashed.
@theintellect111: @realdonaldtrump mr trump please do not give in.you are changing history. we need you as our next leader its your time

@jennaleeusa: when asked why he has his own magazine covers on his walls - @realdonaldtrump replies: it's cheaper than wall paper... ha!
@adiosliberty: @60minutes @realdonaldtrump @scottpelley haven't seen that much hatred in an interviewer since the 1st debate. #trump2016
@yang karl: all scott pelley did by being disrespectful was make it easier to make up my mind who to vote for and that will be trump.

@polina6: @realdonaldtrump man with a plan-the best tax plan! go trump 2016!
prediction: rand paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon. 1 !
i hope when rand paul gets out of the racehe is at 1 --his supporters come over to me. i will do a much better job for them.
definitely watch @carl c icahn s danger ahead. very insightful particularly on how corp inversions hurt america:
carl icahn said this about me: i think at this moment in time hes the only candidate that speaks out about the countrys problems.
great!
i watched lightweight senator marco rubio who is all talk and no action defend his weak position on illegal immigration. pathetic!
just read that trump has the largest and i add most enthusiastic crowds. tonight i will be in new hampshire - the place will be packed!
@kissmeandrocco: @realdonaldtrump who ever thinks donald trump is a bad person u just don't want a good country thank you.

the @gop should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @cnbc is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.
.@cnbc is pushing the @gop around by asking for extra time and no criteria in order to sell more commercials.
why is the @gop being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #demdebate?
will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle. enjoy!
@davidaxelrod: .met @ivankatrump a few years back. donaldtrump is wise to enlist his daughter's help. she's a throughly impressive person.

megyn kelly has two really dumb puppets chris stirewalt & marc threaten a bushy who do exactly what she says. all polls say i won debates
.@marcthiessen is a failed bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. a third rate talent!
every poll time drudge slate and others said i won both debates - but heard megyn kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. i don't watch
@rickstans1: donald megyn kelly seeks ratings not truth not much of a journalist. stay focused & make your own narrative. it's working
@hohummm: did you also hear megyn say carson is the front-runner ...according so some polls ..tied in other polls outright lie! hatred!
@lance combrink: @realdonaldtrump karl rove still thinks romney won. why is he still on tv?

.@mittromney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because i have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to obama!
.@mittromney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost!
does everyone remember @mittromney and his famous remarks about self-deportation and 47 . he was done. i don't need his angry advice!

anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for marco rubio read this:
jeb's new slogan - jeb can fix it . i never thought of jeb as a crook! stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics!
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other. marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor!
marco rubio will not win. weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight .
if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate. bad facts for marco if properly delivered!
join me tuesday nov. 3rd at 12 pm in #trumptower in nyc. i'll be signing copies of my book crippled america. don't miss it!
while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear: that hillary does not want to run against trump.

also tune in to the @todayshow at 7:00am. i will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #crippledamerica.
jeb bush just said about marco rubio he's my friend! pure political speak. why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend!
@spiritofshiloh: carson has the worst health plan ever re: soc sec and medicare. @realdonaldtrump he wants to abolish medicare - no way!
@destiny: why didn't @seanhannity correct jeb when he said @realdonaldtrump has run 4 president 2x b4 jeb needs 2b corrected b c he lied.
@lizzym420: @amrightnow @realdonaldtrump what other candidate begins to rival trump in his knowledge breadth of issues stamina? thanks!
@hanan khan2: @realdonaldtrump i am a lifelong democrat. and i will be voting trump!!!! #democratsfortrump great!
.@seanhannity should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice. never ran merely considered running!
@curtismuddog: @destiny @seanhannity jeb's! whole campaign is fueled by lies. just like his brother lied about iraq. bush dynasty lies
@nottaliberal: @realdonaldtrump @destiny @seanhannity no need everyone knows jeb is full of blank.
@teamspringsteen: @realdonaldtrump i just finished reading crippled america. it's a detailed blueprint to get america back on track.
@marklindsay78: @hanan khan2 @realdonaldtrump poll numbers are higher then most think no one is asking democrats if they are voting trump
rubio lied about my meeting w hispanic activists. i didnt change my opinion but treated them w respect. shame!
@reagan girl: msm are lying to you about hispanics hating trump. here's the real deal! #hispanicsfortrump
the carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
@sandrajenners: i love to see the respect you have shown to your parents siblings and children. proven respect and class needed in usa!
@chriskyleband: trump supporters aren't angry we're smart ! we're men women millennials politically saavy
@keksec org: @realdonaldtrump ivanka said it and you said it too you'll be great for women. #makeamericagreatagain
@socal4trump: wow @megynkelly. you openly lie about who's ahead in the gop race. trump is leading in 99 of polls. shameful... #stopthelies
a great honor to easily finish first in the @foxnews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!
@deemcna: @foxnews silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like ben carson but wants america rebuilt by only one capable:trump
@rick sa: @greta interesting presidential race carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer and @realdonaldtrump beats carson in the polls!
@reganharycki: @realdonaldtrump it's about time we find a republican that can take on the democrats!
@grundleman27: marco rubio can't even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the u.s. finances #trump
@aliceengle3: @realdonaldtrump-huge lead in reuters national poll
@rhinostate: .@realdonaldtrump @grundleman27 rubio is a manchurian candidate. people will own him if he ever became president.
florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio. so do two people who worked with him. said he used the wrong credit card! sure.
such bad reporting: a puff piece on ben carson in the @nytimes states that carson is trying to solidify his lead. but i am #1 easily! sad
with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
carson now admits his friend named bob who he tried to stab bob was saved by his belt buckle! no longer exists as bob. wrong name!
i think it would be a good ideaand fairto include @govchristie & @mikehuckabeegop in the debate. both solid & good guys. @foxbusiness
.@ajdelgado13 thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.
@jimmyfortrump: @insighter007 @oamericangirl all rep should stand with #trump2016 forget bush rubio and knife attackers! #trump2016
@robostop10: @realdonaldtrump this is not good. wow one of many lies by ben carson! big story.
getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.
@captainmark : @robostop10 keep it comming trump!!!! people need to be warned about that carson figure who is not who they think!
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump @robostop10 @politico how anyone could see him as president baffles me. lies and insane theories.
@trumpsmyhomeboy: @realdonaldtrump @robostop10 @politico the #msm straw man candidate is falling apart!

@phinsdiehard: @cnn only donald trump can #makeamericagreatagain thank you!
@fbeadon: @realdonaldtrump don't let the keystone pipeline die. the us needs to be good neighbors with canada and energy independent.
@billkristol has become a sad case. his magazine is failing badly probably doesn't have long to go and his predictions are always wrong!
would be nice if @jmartnyt learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. probably done on purpose but not good reporting!
@nbcsnl: one more day! donald trump hosts #snl with @sia tomorrow. will be a wild night!
@bubbachitchat1: this is why the polls are wrong! @hanan khan2: i am a lifelong democrat. and i will be voting trump! #democratsfortrump

a great evening in springfield illinois. thank you for all of the support! #trump2016
marco rubio is a total lightweight who i wouldnt hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
marco rubio couldn't even respond properly to president obama's state of the union speech without pouring sweat & chugging water. he choked!
marco rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration & in favor of easy amnesty. a lightweight choker - bad for #usa!
thank you to @nypost's robert rorke for the really nice review of #snl. so many enjoyed it - very gratifying!

happy veterans day. to those who have served thank you for your special work.
just returned home from the great state of new hampshire. have made so many friends there--special place!
i never said that china was in the bad tpp trade deal but that china would come in the back door at a later date. @cnn @foxbusiness
.@gerardtbaker gerardwonderful job last night as moderator of the debate. i told many really smart and elegant.
i will be on @marklevinshow at 8pm tonight. tune in!
will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm.
@christianlord12: rubio sat back during debate on immigration hoping no 1 would ask him about gang of 8.
@frankieguy85: this 92-year-old woman registered to vote just to cast a ballot for trump
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump you will bring out more voters to vote for you than we've seen in any election! great.
@ellenespence: i'm not convinced that any candidate other than @realdonaldtrump is committed to securing our borders. #votetrump2016
all seven on-line polls including drudge and time with thousands of respondents said i won the debate. @krauthammer said i was so so.
i will be interviewed on @mariabartiromo @foxbusiness at 7:30
today's @wsj editorial is wrong again. i know that china is not in the new t.p.p. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.
.@wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and t.p.p. and apologize. china not part but will get their way in later.
the @wsj editorial board is so wrong so often. they got info from an incorrect story in another pub. why not watch and listen to debate.
when and how are the dummies at the @wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me. i want smart trade deals.
why wouldn't the @wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. no wonder it is doing poorly!
we as a country either have borders or we don't. if we don't have borders we don't have a country!
.@karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp. this moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100
why does the failing @wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy @karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?
.@wsj and dopey karl rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible tpp deal.
total fool @karlrove is part of the republican establishment problem. an all talk no action dummy!
wow pres. candidate ben carson who is very weak on illegal immigration just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.
from 2 to 27 in texas - quite a jump into first place!
thank you @forbes for showing the @wsj was wrong. so dishonest!
macys was very disloyal to me bc of my strong stance on illegal immigration. their stock has crashed! #boycottmacys
i will be on with @bretbaier tonight at 6pm. #trump2016

@drudge report: reuters 5-day rolling poll: trump 34 carson 19.6 rubio 9.7 cruz 7.7 ... thank you - a great honor!
.@carlyfiorina carly not just you i also told gov. kasich to let jeb talk give him a chance because kasich was constantly cutting in.
.@carlyfiorina carlyi did graduate from wharton and did very well. who is your fact checker? will you apologize?
.@carlyfiorina ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. i didnt say it he did. apology?
.@carlyfiorina i only said i was on @60minutes four weeks ago with putinnever said i was in green room. separate piecesgreat ratings!
.@carlyfiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning ben carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!
.@seanhannity carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! sad.
great honor to be inducted into the nj boxing hall of fame last night. thank you! timing could not have been better!
thank you @jaketapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. should have been done long ago. #trump2016

boy is this guy @shepnewsteam tough on me. so totally biased. as a reporter he should be ashamed of himself! #trump2016
my prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible paris attacks. may god be with you all.

hillary and sanders are not doing well but what is the failed former mayor of baltimore doing on that stage? o'malley is a clown.

.@johnlegere @tmobile john focus on running your company i think the service is terrible! try hiring some good managers.
president obama just told president putin how important the russian air strikes against isis have been. i told you so!
tom brady just did it again. he is not only a great guy he is without question the best quarterback!
@streetr77: @johnlegere @tmobile didn't know he was ceo of tmobile i have t-mobile it's pathetic dropped calls no service.
@sarahpalinusa: from st. patrick's cathedral nyc: blessings prayers and heartfelt concern for those in paris.

so many great polls like reuters - big leads everywhere. new hampshire really special! we will win big and make america great again!
i along with almost everyone else have so little confidence in president obama. he has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat
refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country. who knows who they are - some could be isis. is our president insane?
gop voters trust donald trump to keep our country safe
what is our president doing?
one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @ap. they have lost their way and are no longer credible.
.@ap is doing very badly. i can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate. sadly they are now irrelevant!
melania and i just had interview with the legendary @barbarajwalters. watch #abc2020 this friday. tonight we talk isis @wntonight

great new poll
very nice article from daily mail
via politico: trump extends lead in new hampshire poll
@foxnews new hampshire poll: @realdonaldtrump 'rules gop race in new hampshire.' trump 27 rubio 13 cruz 11 bush 9 carson 9 & kasich 7
eight syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the u.s. isis maybe? i told you so. we need a big & beautiful wall!
everyone is now saying how right i was with illegal immigration & the wall. after paris theyre all on the bandwagon.
the police in paris did a fantastic job. very brave - not easy!
thank you for your support! together we can #makeamericagreatagain! #trump2016

the legendary barbara walters interviews melania trump and me on a special this friday night at 10:00 on abc. don't miss it!
governor kasich whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
john kasich despite being governor of ohio is losing to me in the ohio polls. pathetic!
i want to do negative ads on john kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that i dont want to waste my money.
watch kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun!
kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down. people from nh are smart!
i loved beating john kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last!
doesnt help kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - hes almost last.
john kasich fell right into president obamas trap on obamacare and the people of ohio are suffering for it. shame!
once john kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete & total dud!
john kasich was managing director of lehman brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. a total failure!
a great evening in iowa! thank you des moines area community college for a great forum! #trump2016 #iaforums
a wonderful afternoon in iowa! great people! heading now to florida - tomorrow south carolina! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
the media must immediately stop calling isis leaders masterminds. call them instead thugs and losers. young people must not go into isis!
the media must denigrate isis at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. these are low level degenerates not masterminds!
going to south carolina now great place sro crowd. iowa was amazing yesterday!
.@mkhammer a fox contributor isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @thejuanwilliams made the point far better!
my family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary @barbarajwalters tonight @abc - 10pme.
under our president isis is gaining great strength-
i didn't suggest a database-a reporter did. we must defeat islamic terrorism & have surveillance including a watch list to protect america
thank you for a great afternoon south carolina! see you next tuesday! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
can you believe the worst mayor in the u.s. & probably the worst mayor in the history of #nyc @billdeblasio just called me a blow hard!

@keeping real: so good to see the @realdonaldtrump family out with him on the campaign trail! it really shows the family man that he is!
the failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on donald trump!
@riosunny3: @realdonaldtrump @wkrg i lived in new jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well.
the @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. with unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
the dopes at the @nytimes bought the boston globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. their great old headquarters-gave it away! so dumb
so since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write. incompetent!
the numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal especially advertising revenue that big help will be needed fast. a once great institution-sad!
happy thanksgiving to all. have a great day and look forward to the future. we will make america great again!
@prisonplanet: .@realdonaldtrump gets it. never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended media.
great new poll numbers! thank you for your support! #trump2016

the @washingtonpost which loses a fortune is owned by @jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company @amazon.

.@chucktodd is a nice guy but just hopeless. he knows so little about politics and in particular winning! i fixed his rating problem.

@jpmorgan2016: @realdonaldtrump @peggynoonannyc trump is winning by so much more it's near 60 nationally. they are all biased polls!!!!
@yoel ny: @realdonaldtrump @peggynoonannyc as a democrat i have to say since hillary is the front-runner i will choose trump.
@dragonian3333: @danscavino @seanhannity cruz doesn't do anything about illegals and refugees invading texas.

.@danawhite great job last night - very exciting! you have come a long way from those difficult early days i am proud of you.

@vylvisaker: @anncoulter trump has stamina he is working harder than any other candidate. he really loves america . he deserves to win.
@schnoepoe: @foxnews i find myself more and more drawn to cnn for fairness regarding @realdonaldtrump the fox news sunday pundits a joke!
@theprodigy3d: everyone vote for @realdonaldtrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement.
i did interview with chris wallace of @foxnews in order to be fair. he then puts on rove lane and will three trump bashers to discuss.
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it. well welcome to the wonderful world of politics!
@energy43: @schnoepoe @foxnews not so much fairness as it is about ratings . megan kellys hate nightly of trump is turn-off for fox
@1rdgreenberg: @foxnews that's why after your interview i couldn't watch the panel discussion which is usually my favorite segment.
@jpmorgan2016: trump needs his own poll a real poll in every state. these polls are so ridiculous.the media will only get worse from here
@trumpisawinner: .you're the real deal. for my money tedcruz just doesn't cut the mustard. go trump! #donaldtrump #thedonald
@lesgartcpa: @jaketapper @realdonaldtrump problem is i never watched you until trump started giving you interviews and ratings on cnn.
@ajodom60: @foxnews and as far as that low-info voter base goes i have an iq of 132. so much for that theory. #makeamericagreatagain
people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
@barbara nc: trump did not need 2acquire wealth & power owes nothing to anyone. candidates owe their backers

wow i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from @abc @washingtonpost - 38 . make america great again!
isn't it amazing that @cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll which shows me in first place over cruz by 13 33 to 20 - then doesn't use it
why isn't anyone using the @cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead. they only want to use the one negative poll 2nd place .dishonest press
.@megynkelly the most overrated anchor at @foxnews worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. she said 15!
.@megynkelly is very bad at math. she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14.
i wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. no matter how well i do - bad!
i am in trump international hotel las vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. look forward - hope i get treated fairly!
between iraq war monger @krauthammer dummy @karlrove deadpan @georgezwill highly overrated @megynkelly among others @foxnews not fair!

@twlhb: @realdonaldtrump @governorpataki just called you this president !!! but i don't want his endorsement!

.@melindadc dont misrepresent in order to make a point. i was always tough on isis--as youll find out after i get elected.
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name & dont be ashamed of it!
weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
.@jebbush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for president. he should remain true to himself.
the last thing our country needs is another bush! dumb as a rock!
thank you for all of your support! most importantly - we need to get everyone out to vote! #votetrump2016

@williamesammon1: #hillaryforprison2016
see sanders backed hillary on e-mails at the debate hurting himself and then she threw him under the bus but failed . disloyal person!
president obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to hawaii on a massive old 747.

@constant4change: trump tops dem candidates on google before dem debate
@aniesiodaniels: #demdebate q: who are you voting for in 2016. a: #trump! donald trump! donald trump!. #trump2016
hillary clinton lied when she said that isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool. this was fact checked by @foxnews: false
@blueeyd2020: @jebbush reminds me now of @bobbyjindal but no one cares jeb! you lost your chance. #trump2016 @realdonaldtrump
we need a #potus with great strength & stamina. hillary does not have that.#trump2016
.@jebbush was terrible on face the nation today. being at 2 and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. a basket case!
hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me. therefore hillary lied at the debate last night. sad!
it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night. not very presidential!
my friend @ariemanuel of @img bought the miss universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #fox! tune in!
.@missuniverse final 3 on now. great people great new owner @img. watch.

great poll out of illinois! thank you!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
.@jebbush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner he would rather be where he is now 2 . that is the talk of a loser can't win!
@drdoucette: #missuniverse donaldtrump must be overjoyed that as soon as he sells the pageant it goes off the rails. we need you mr trump
@msully65: tell this knitwit @speakerryan the ppl want @realdonaldtrump not him or his choice for president! thts why trump has 40
very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant. i sold it 6 months ago for a record price. this would never have happened!
hillary said at debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst. she made up story-want apology!
i demand an apology from hillary clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. there never was a video.
hillary said with respect to isis we are finally where we need to be. do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? maga!
just out: trump gop debate - 18000000. clinton democrat debate - 6700000. and they were on major network vs. cable!
getting ready to go to the great state of michigan. big crowd tonight. make america great again!
phyllis schlafly: trump is 'last hope for america'
it's the democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to isis -- not a tape of donald trump that was an admitted hillary lie!
@drudge report: update: isis jihadists stole 'tens of thousands' of blank passports... here we go!
a suicide bomber has just killed u.s. troops in afghanistan. when will our leaders get tough and smart. we are being led to slaughter!
thanks @andreatantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. big progress is being made. keep up the great work!
do you think that hillary clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by isis. there is no video.
getting ready to leave for michigan - will be an amazing evening! see you there.
@herschelwalker thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated!

@philmonaco67: @realdonaldtrump 100 donald trump supporter go trump make america great again
@realnevadie: this suggests that online polls are more reliable so trump is crushing both parties. @realdonaldtrump
@ msfl : @realdonaldtrump @trumpusa16 a great patriot
weak and low energy @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.
.@jebbush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. will never work!
will @jebbush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
why doesn't @jebbush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate?
.@jebbush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around incoherent.
@qbeacademy: well i'm at 42 and your at 3 .you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage. classic
@schoremis1: @jebbush the donald should've been named man of the year. he dominates the polls news talk shows & social media. maga!
women defy media narrative love trump at packed michigan rally.video:
watching @cnn and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. boring and biased!
jeb's big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements. he is really pathetic!
once again #msm is dishonest. schlonged is not vulgar. when i said hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly.
npr's @nealconan said schlonged to wapo re: 1984 mondale ferraro campaign: that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls. #hypocrisy
for those on tv defending my use of the word schlonged bc #msm is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. dishonest #msm
wow new reuters poll just out. big lead if you want to make america great again! trump 37 cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly. the media knows this. often used word in politics!
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. sad!
we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
big news just out - new @cnn poll trump 39 and leads in every major category. likeability way up. cruz 18 carson 10 rubio 10
thank you america! together- we will #makeamericagreatagain!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
the silent majority- is silent no more! remember the importance of voting!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
the @washingtonpost which is the lobbyist power for not imposing taxes on #amazon today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. bad
.@foxnews treats me so badly. using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll. all negative!
why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime. he and other fox pundits is so biased. still thinks romney won. unfair coverage of trump
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media. new @cnn poll amazing in all categories. 21 pt. lead
hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to. i have great respect for women. be careful!
merry christmas & happy holidays!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. i deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity
@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal. good question!
@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal.
a great christmas movie & perfect #tbt! #makeamericagreatagain story:
@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit jim you fail to mention in your cnn poll that in the gop race...trump is leading cruz 39 to 18...big detail
poor @jebbush spent $50 million on his campaign i spent almost nothing. he's bottom and gone i'm top by a lot . that's what u.s. needs!
in the ridiculous @jebbush ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn't allow my answer which destroys him - so sad!
wow even lowly rand paul has just past @jebbush in the new @cnn poll. jeb is at 3 i'm at 39 . stop throwing your money down the drain!
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias. think about bill!
next year will be an interesting one. i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids. it's about time!
why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll? cnn even better!
.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @cnn poll where i am at 39 21points higher than cruz. be honest chuck!
i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight. make america great again!
@yesmrgilbert: @nbcnightlynews @halliejackson should have talked to megyn kelly about this story true a total distortion of the facts!
.@halliejackson why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video. bad reporting. perhaps @nbc will do better next year-but doubt it!
.@danielhalper great job on @cnn today. very wise indeed!
merry christmas to all. have a great day and have a really amazing year. together we will make america great again! it will be done!
.@deedeesorvino was great today on @foxnews she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly. have her on more!
does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally. politics!
we have many problems in our house country! and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. make america great again!
remember when failed candidate @jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love? he's spent $59 million and is at 3 .
our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the v.a. that will stop i will fix this quickly!
when will the democrats and hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and mexico is going to pay for it? never!
@classysnobbb: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews i'm reading #crippledamerica! best book ever. thank you!
@jacobsac2015: @foxnews thank you for your tweet today on christmas. can't wait to see you as president mr. trump. you are awesome.
@jodil792: you know what's making my christmas great family food friends&you! i have my trump shirt on w hope in my heart for america
@deedeegop: thank u mr. trump i look forward to when u are elected next president of the united states #makeamericagreatagain. so nice!
@cnn just announced that trump was #1 story of 2015. totally meaningless however if we don't win it all and make america great again!
.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until i came along-no ratings. i will beat hillary!
the same people that said i wouldn't run or that i wouldn't lead or do well 1st place and leading by 21 now say i won't beat hillary.
the phoenix v.a. it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before. the wait is horrendous and people are dying. i will fix it
criminal deportations in the u.s. are the lowest number in many years. we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. must change!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016 story:
a new terror warning was issued for european cties. at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. weak leaders!
@greta: if the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still largeobamacare is a failure since so expensive
hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate!
thank you! #trump2016
i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to do-no strength stamina!
@sir max: andreajmarkley: rubio finally gets an endorsement from #benghazi loser gowdy #tcot #pjnet via dailyne
@mitchellvii: face it trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi. he allowed it to drag out and in the end let hillary get away with murder.
@mitchellvii: my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy.
@cac8438: he supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that trey gowdy is going to campaign with him.
it begins republican party of virginia controlled by the rnc is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters. bad!
r.p.virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. will now not allow desperately needed new voters. suicidal mistake. rnc must act now!
the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. the dems love it! be smart and win for a change!
.@berniesanders-who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e-mail crime said that i feel wages in america are too high. lie!
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late. stupid! rnc
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party. fast!
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done and that's why we want you! thank you.
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women's card on me she's wrong!
the middle-class has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no effective raise in years. bad
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries. we now are part time sad! i will fix!
wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few and people have lost faith in our leaders.we need smart and strong leadership now!
strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes while he will double & triple them a disaster!
thank you to a #trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. video:

@umakemeill: @foxnews @jebbush @hillaryclinton @realdonaldtrump
@leemiracle3: @foxnews @charleshurt @realdonaldtrump trump listening to voters unlike gop
remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008. he was terrible failed badly and was called a racist!
.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews - he really gets it!
minorities line up behind.....donald trump #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain
my campaign for president is $35000000 under budget i have spent very little and am in 1st place .now i will spend big in iowa n.h. s.c.
so i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. jeb bush has spent $59 million & done. run country my way!
looking forward to being in council bluffs iowa later today. despite weather rally is on -- will be fantastic! #makeamericagreatagain!
we need a real president!
i hope @tgowdysc does better for rubio than he did at the #benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for republicans & america!
shows how dumb joe mcquaid @deucecrew of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn't do his failed debate!
the great people of new hampshire who i love are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper.
joe mcquaid @deucecrew of the dying union leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.
thank you council bluffs iowa! the silent majority is silent no more!#trump2016 #fitn
.@charleshurt you were great on @seanhannity last night. thanks for the nice words. make america great again!

@truthisall1: @realdonaldtrump @charleshurt @seanhannity good morning mr. trump. you're so awesome. #trump2016
the dying @unionleader newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!
joe mcquaid @deucecrew is desperately trying to sell the @unionleader. it's a loser and my comments haven't helped him much.
i never thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed @richlowry on television lately and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity
thank you hilton head south carolina! @scteamtrump #trump2016

@luciano031982: @realdonaldtrump veterans love trump but i love the vets even more!

@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @hughhewitt i get pissed off every time i see his ads on fox. waste of money! go trump! many do!
people ask why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @jebbush when he is so low in the polls? because of his big $ hit ads on me!
@insidegym: the most influential u.s. gymnasts of all time: @nastialiukin @shawnjohnson @asaq 3 fantastic shawn
@bretbaier: .@realdonaldtrump's reaction that @lindseygrahamsc is dropping out of the 2016 race. your thoughts?

@stylin1188: donald trump is running the most cost-effective presidential campaign in modern history thank you!
@wmsolomon: 'on point' with gov. sarah palin & donald trump

@whispers34: nevada poll: donald trump 33 ted cruz 20 marco rubio 11 ... via @thelastrefuge2 great news!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
i would feel sorry for @jebbush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me
happy birthday to my son @donaldjtrumpjr! very proud of you! #tbt
thank you illinois! let's not forget to get family & friends- out to vote in 2016!
do you believe that the state department on new year's eve just released more of hillary's e-mails. they just want it all to end. bad!
i would like to wish everyone a happy and healthy new year. we must all work together to finally make america safe again and great again!
i will be on @foxnews live with members of my family at 11:50 p.m. we will ring in the new year together! make america great again!

#happynewyearamerica!
happy new year from #maralago! thank you to my great family for all of their support.
@jallenaip: hillary said she was in a fog of war as explanation for the lies about benghazi. no fog allowed in wh. vote trump potus!
@sprinklermanus: @cnn @realdonaldtrump they're spending millions but you're still going to win - go donald trump
well the year has officially begun. i have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
@marie7777777777: @realdonaldtrump we love u to trump family. god bless you.
@jodil792: we are standing with you! spreading the word...trump for president 2016!! i wake & sleep praying for you & the usa! israel2
@memeoryhead: i'm one of your biggest fans mr trump and i can't wait for you to make america great ifagain! never forget you have support!
@casuperrunner: @georgehenryw huckabee is a good man...but he needs to get behind @realdonaldtrump i agree!
i will be going to mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! look forward to it.
@codyraymille: i have never been interested in politics but because of you i want to get my political science degree. #trump2016 great!
the person that hillary clinton least wants to run against is by far me. it will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
thank you so much to for naming me the 2015 man of the year. this is indeed a great honor for me!
#votetrump2016 & together we will #makeamericagreatagain! thank you for your support!
massive crowds expected in mississippi tomorrow night. look forward to it! 2015 in photos:
.@jebbush is a sad case. a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads!
.@jebbush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. has no chance!
hillary clinton said that it is o.k. to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not o.k. to do so in the u.s. we must be vigilant!
hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better!
i hope bill clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women!
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
remember i am self-funding my campaign the only one in either party. i'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the u.s.a.!
heading to biloxi mississippi. massive crowds expected. thank you for your support! #votetrump2016
just arrived in mississippi for the rally. word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. will be an amazing evening!
@granite hope: @brandonstinney how can you deny this fact.hillaryclinton and barackobama are the two people who made #isis a big problem
thank you #biloxi #mississippi! remember this night & spread the word to get out & #votetrump2016!
@namusca: @realdonaldtrump @erictrump @diamondandsilk #trump is much better than any rock concert! he knows how to fill a stadium.
@mmmdigits: well done #biloxi....great display of southern pride and hospitality at @realdonaldtrump event. fired up and ready to go!!
just returned from mississippi - a great evening.
hillary clinton lied last week when she said isis made a d.t. video. the video that isis made was about her husband being a degenerate.
al-shabbab not isis just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if i speak out against them which i must. hillary lied!
hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. if she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
thank you for your support in biloxi ms! let's all get out & vote in 2016 so we can #makeamericagreatagain!
does anybody remember when bill clinton in 2008 worked long and hard for hillary? she lost! now bill is at it again. just watch.
.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that attacking bill to get to hillary has never worked before. wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!
.@ruthmarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on face the nation.no focus poor level of concentration-but correct on hillary lying
@tinahillstrom1: @foxnews @katrinapierson i love @piersmorgan & @realdonaldtrump real men w an opinion exciting interesting controversial
@barbaraslavin1: @ruthmarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes she is 3rd rate a total dummy!
iran with all of the money and all else given to them by obama has wanted a way to take over saudi arabia & their oil. they just found it!
the worst thing hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. just watch.
by the way hillary & the msm forgot to mention that hillary is in the al-shabaab terror video.
@icareeguns: this #iowan is voting for @realdonaldtrump #iacaucus. thank you for supporting iowa! my great honor

i dont cheat at golf but @samuelljackson cheatswith his game he has no choiceand stop doing commercials!

huge crowd expected tomorrow night! vt police say first come first serve. arrive early!
i will be on @wolfblitzer for a @cnnsitroom interview today. please join us 5pm et.
do you believe that @unionleader in nh was demanding ads? look at enclosed letter from them just received:
the failing @unionleader newspaper in n.h. just sent the trump organization a letter asking that we take ads. how stupid how desperate!
.@macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the s&p last year plunging 46 . very disloyal company. another win for trump! boycott.
it was a very wise move that ted cruz renounced his canadian citizenship 18 months ago. senator john mccain is certainly no friend of ted!
i will be in beautiful burlington vermont tonight for a rally. will be great fun. make america great again!
man shot inside paris police station. just announced that terror threat is at highest level. germany is a total mess-big crime. get smart!
massive crowd in vt tonight. venue not big enough. officials say no to outside event and sound system. arrive early!
.@sentedcruz ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the dems on citizen issue. go to court now & seek declaratory judgment--you will win!
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising!
hillary and her friends!
the @theview @abc once great when headed by @barbarajwalters is now in total freefall. whoopi goldberg is terrible. very sad!
joy behar who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings is even worse on @theview. we love barbara!
i'm leaving now for burlington vermont. it will be wild!
we could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. the movement to make america great again is unbelievable!
great time in burlington vermont. crowd was amazing.
@hofmannken: donaldtrump wish i could attend one of your rallies none are close enough. make america great again for my kids.thank you
@liberatedcit: @jebbush key state florida poll: trump 32 beats #rubio-#bush combined
@pink sprnva: @pastormike7 @thehill i agree with you on this. @realdonaldtrump won't be good. he will be great!
@rlbenney: @realdonaldtrump you did great and showed courage going to burlington. no other gop candidate would do what you did tonight!
hank greenberg formerly of aig gave $10 million to the @jebbush campaign 3 months ago. he is not happy a total waste of money!
not good news for jeb bush
on my way to south carolina. big crowd--- look forward to it!
i hope all workers demand that their @teamsters reps endorse donald j. trump. nobody knows jobs like i do! dont let them sell you out!
love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to trump. i will create jobs like no one else. their #dem leaders cant compete!
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
#foxnews poll - thank you!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016

pat buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @cnn - way to go pat way ahead of your time!
south carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting and fun . i am now off to iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. love it!
constitutional law expert #laurence tribe of harvard says wrong to say it natural born citizen is a settled matter-it isn't settled .
thank you @thefix- chris cillizza. it is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right.
.@jonahnro watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- i have been waiting for them for a long time. thank you.
thank you so much. earnest must have been a great person.
1 2 time magazine has me on the cover this week. david von drehle has written one of the best stories i have ever had.
2 2 david brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! read it!
i'm protesting the @unionleader from having anything to do w abc debate. their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!
i will be interviewed by chris wallace on fox tomorrow morning. tune in!
will be on meet the press with @chucktodd tomorrow morning. enjoy!
i want to thank the people of iowa for an unbelievable day. the crowds were amazing. will be back tuesday!
@redletter99: trump pummels his opponents - and the press sunherald @realdonaldtrump thank you!
yesterday in iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. they love that i am the only candidate self-funding!
in the just out @foxnews poll i easily beat hillary clinton - and i havn't even focused on her yet. on our way: make america great again!
heading now for reno nevada for a big rally. good poll numberd all over!
remember get time magazine! i am on the cover. take it out in 4 years and read it again! just watch...
i am pleased to announce that i had the union leader removed from the upcoming debate.
if their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isnt questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who cant win.
this is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. i said it should not be allowed and abc agreed.
ul has lost all credibility under joe mcquaid w circulation dropping to record lows. they aren't worthy of representing the great people nh.
union leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the abc news debate like a dog. for starters try getting a new publisher!
thank you to our law enforcement officers! #lesm #trump2016
why does @thisweekabc w @gstephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @abc can do much better than him!
congratulations to my friend @theslystallone on winning a #goldenglobe. a wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!
great job on fox this morning @katiepavlich. i am sending out for your book immediately. thank you very much!
so professional of @abc news to throw out the failing @unionleader newspaper from their debate. paper won't survive highly unethical!
just arrived in new hampshire. thank you to all of my supporters!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
congratulations to @jdickerson of face the nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! thank you!
.@ringlingbros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.
new iowa poll. thank you!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
.@megynkelly recently said that she cant be wooed by trump. she is so average in every way who the hell wants to woo her!
will be on @fallontonight with @jimmyfallon on @nbc at 11:35pme. enjoy! #trump2016
thank you michael harrison @talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!
.@majorcbs major garrett of @cbsnews covers me very inaccurately. total agenda bad reporter!
face the nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. congratulations and wow! @cbsnews @jdickerson
don't forget to watch the tonight show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 p.m. you will not be disappointed! @nbc
fantastic job on @cnn tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon
@clewandowski : .@stuartpstevens --failed strategist who can't find clients criticizes winning #teamtrump. stop complaining & try winning
.@stuartpstevens horrible advise to mitt romney made victory an impossibility. don't blame mitt! now stevens can't get a job!
the tonight show begins in 5 minutes. enjoy!
thank you! #trump2016
on my way to cedar falls iowa now. will be great--i love the people of iowa!
such a serious problem for ted & the gop. great doubt dems will sue! let's all work together to solve this problem.
another new iowa poll just released. thank you! #iacaucus #fitn
new cbs poll. #trump2016
the iran deal is terrible. why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to russia. #sotu
the #sotu speech is really boring slow lethargic - very hard to watch!
just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on iowa push polls negative to me. not nice but ok! new polls are great.
the state of the union speech was one of the most boring rambling and non-substantive i have heard in a long time. new leadership fast!
numerous polls have me beating hillary clinton. in a race with her voter turnout will be the highest in u.s. history-i get most new voters!
iran toys with u.s. days before we pay them ridiculously billions of dollars. don't release money. we want our hostages back now!
thank you for your support last night iowa! #votetrump #trump2016 #iacaucus #fitn #iapolitics
@johnkurkosky: @carolde @the lady colors @drjamescabot @tamidurling @aceofspadeshq this election is about americas future vote trump
sadly there is no way that ted cruz can continue running in the republican primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. dems will sue!
my nomination would increase voter turnout. #votetrump #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
thank you! #votetrump
thank you iowa! highly respected @oann @gravismarketing poll just released. #votetrump #iowacaucus
thank you! #votetrump
.@erictrump- unbelievable job on #foxnews with @greta. that was better than i could do! #trump2016
why does @cnn & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist stuart stevens - who lost big for romney - on the show?
iran humiliated the united states with the capture of our 10 sailors. horrible pictures & images. we are weak. i will not forget!
stuart stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. romney campaignhis booketc. why does @andersoncooper put him on?
united states looks more and more like a paper tiger. won't be that way if i win!
.@thebrodyfile: trump's appeal to evangelicals is real #trump2016
@melindaross123: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump there isn't anything donald trump says that i don't agree with. go trump!
@bonfiredesigns: standing with @realdonaldtrump as he defends our sailors and military and americans in the usa
do you think iran would have acted so tough if they were russian sailors? our country was humiliated.
@wpjenna: thousands packed into the pensacola bay center to see donald trump tonight... a fantastic evening!
@clewandowski : massive crowd in pensacola florida! unbelievable! thank you! #votetrump
@ameriflames: @realdonaldtrump @clewandowski no one wants a bush or a clinton they want a straight shooter like trump!
@ bscarb: enjoyed watching @realdonaldtrump at his rally yesterday! i've never seen the bay center that packed!
wsj nbc poll: donald trump widens his lead in republican presidential race. #trump2016
jeb bush who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero just got graham endorsement. graham quit at o.
sen. lindsey graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for president and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of bush.
top searched candidate by state as seen in the #gopdebate media filing center. we will make america great again!
jusr watched #harveypitt on @teamcavuto - he was great!
@geraldorivera @sentedcruz got ass kicked by @realdonaldtrump last night-he offended every new yorker & has no answer to natural born issue
.@geraldorivera thank you geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. you are a true champion! thank @ericbolling - great guy!
just got back from iowa - had a great time with amazing people. will be back soon!
.@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that i supported john mccain big league in 2008 not obama!
.@frankluntz is a total clown. has zero credibility! @foxnews @megynkelly
more radical islam attacks today - it never ends! strengthen the borders we must be vigilant and smart. no more being politically correct.
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago. lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. i told you so
ted cruz said he didn't know that he was a canadian citizen. he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papers.not believable
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file. goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand. not much of a reformer!
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace. remember his wife's employer and his lender is located there!
oh no just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan this one from citi. wow no wonder banks do so well in the u.s. senate.
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks?
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. they own him!
great new numbers. thank you! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
ted is the ultimate hypocrite. says one thing for money does another for votes.
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
everybody that loves the people of new york and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics!
when will @tedcruz give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
greatly dishonest of @tedcruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up wall st
departing nh now- great morning with record crowd in portsmouth- in a snow storm! thank you!
wow! ted cruz received $487k in campaign contributions $11m from a ny hedge fund mogul & $1m low int. loan from goldman sachs. hypocrite
is this the new york that ted cruz is talking about & demeaning?
interesting read from peggy noonan.
in iran deal we get 4 prisoners. they get $150 billion 7 most wanted and many off watch list. this will create great incentive for others!
iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from u.s. rather airbus!
big announcement in ames iowa on tuesday! you will not want to miss this rally! #trump2016
far more killed than anticipated in radical islamic terror attack yesterday. get tough and smart u.s. or we won't have a country anymore!
i am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money not controlled. cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his n.y. bosses.
@pbralick: @benkissel great on @greggutfeld @greggutfeldshow @jonosuchinsky too thank you ben for your nice comments on debate!
thank you @ivankatrump for the kind words. i am very proud of the role model you are for so many. nh & ia radio ad:
just a reminder that ted cruz supported liberal justice john roberts who gave us #obamacare.
leaving for liberty university. i'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #trump2016
a great morning with everyone @libertyu! thank you! off to new hampshire now. #trump2016
we launched a new series of #trump2016 videos via facebook. a new topic everyday! watch:
i loved being at liberty university today! record setting crowd unbelievable people! thank you jerry and becki!
ted cruz is falling in the polls. he is nervous. people are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
i don't think ted cruz can even run for president until he can assure republican voters that being born in canada is not a problem. doubt!
.@thebrodyfile exclusive: @realdonaldtrump says he will protect evangelicals better than @tedcruz #cbnnews #2016
.@thebrodyfile great job on @ac360. thank you for the very smart and kind words!
wow new polls just out have trump up and cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!
.@tedcruz conflicting stances on birthright citizenship 14th amendment gives #teamtrump credit.
dope frank bruni said i called many people including karl rove losers-true! i never called my friend @howardstern a loser- hes a winner!
really disgusting that the failing new york times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.

thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to liberty university yesterday- @jerryjrfalwell.
in the just released sc poll i increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. up by 14! cruz dropped 3.
a true honor to receive the endorsement of john wayne's daughter....read:
wow the highly respected governor of iowa just stated that ted cruz must be defeated. big shoker! people do not like ted.

so sad that @cnn and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in oklahoma. dishonest reporting!
sad sack @jebbush has just done another ad on me with special interest money saying i won't beat hillary - i will. but he can't beat me.
low energy candidate @jebbush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. millions spent on me. he should go home and relax!
new day on cnn treats me very badly. @alisyncamerota is a disaster. not going to watch anymore.

national review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. it's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. sad!
very few people read the national review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.
the late great william f. buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize the dying national review!
ted cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldn't have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines.

highly respected constitutional law professor mary brigid mcmanamon has just stated ted cruz is not eligible to be president. big problem
@d: #marybrigidmcmanamon washington post: constitutionally speaking #cruz simply isnt eligible to be president
@cyberciety: #marybrigidmcmanamon clarified how #commonlaw is used to interpret meaning of #naturalborn #tedcruz
@miaminewtimes: poll: trump has more support in florida than rubio and bush combined.
the failing @nro national review magazine has just been informed by the republican national committee that they cannot participate in debate
after spending $89 million @jebbush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. he is ashamed to use the name bush in ads. low energy guy!
@lisa milicaj: truth be told i never heard of the national review until they tried to declare war on you. no worries you got my vote!
@whitegenocidetm: @realdonaldtrump poor jeb. i could've sworn i saw him outside trump tower the other day!

rush limbaugh is great tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! thanks rush! #trump2016
ted cruz went down big in just released reuters poll - what's going on? is it goldman sachs citi loans or canada?
just watched jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. jeb --- mom can't help you with isis the chinese or with putin.
.@brentbozell one of the national review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. why doesn't he say that?
the only reason irrelevant @glennbeck doesn't like me is i refused to do his failing show - asked many times. very few listeners - sad!
cruz says i supported tarp which gave $25 million to goldman sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. puppet!
cruz did not renounce his canadian citizenship as a us senator- only when he started to run for #potus. he could be canadian prime minister.
is cruz honest? he is in bed w wall st. & is funded by goldman sachs citi low interest loans. no legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
a wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. i am for the people and the people are for me. #trump2016

ted cruz poll numbers are down big. because he was born in canada and was until recently a canadian citizen many believe he cannot run!
heading to sioux county iowa where the crowd is amazing. dr. robert jeffress will make the introduction. make america great again!
based on @megynkelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.
failing @glennbeck lost all credibility. not only was he fired @ fox he would have voted for clinton over mccain.

.@bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a u.s. senator. how the hell did he ever get elected? @greta
amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like @bensasse who is easy to endorse him. not one senator is endorsing canada ted!

.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed cruz. @foxandfriends
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife melania. after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state!
ted cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run born in canada . will loose big to hillary. polls show i beat hillary easily! win!
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form. very low interest loans scam!
wow just saw an ad - cruz is lying on so many levels. there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal & replace. he lies!
by not doing the failed poorly rated debate i was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness - while raising $6000000 for vets.
if i would have done the last debate a record would have been set instead of the poor ratings recieved . also vets got $6000000.

my experience in iowa was a great one. i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. nice
because i was told i could not do well in iowa i spent very little there - a fraction of cruz & rubio. came in a strong second. great honor
the media has not covered my long-shot great finish in iowa fairly. brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in new hampshire. big crowd
i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. i will keep doing but not worth it!

@stephbewitching @realdonaldtrump all you haters need to realize trump got the second highest vote in history. and he's never held office!
anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment!
on my way to new hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! #fitn #trump2016
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. we said no and she went hostile. a real dummy! @cnn
ted cruz didn't win iowa he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!
during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz.
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters.
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter grade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice - a total lie!
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified.
i will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 p.m. enjoy! @foxnews
this was sent out from ted cruz- as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #cruzfraud
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
cruz just lied again- i am and have been totally against #obamacare- repeal and replace!
dr. ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies.
thank you new hampshire! #makeamericagreatagain #fitn
stop the assault on american values. stand w trump to #makeamericagreatagain!#votersspeak:
thank you to everyone in little rock arkansas tonight! a record crowd of 12k. #trump2016
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. he would be so easy to beat!
thank you @billoreilly & @karlrove. ted cruz should be immediately disqualified in iowa with each candidate moving up one notch.
#icymi: @karlrove & @oreillyfactor discuss what ted cruz did to the great people of iowa- as they went to vote.
.@oreillyfactor @karlrove- as per the show an even more serious cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
this is the cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum.
politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd amendment. i wont let them take away our guns! #trump2016watch:

@newtgingrich: trump shows courage in defending eminent domain as a necessity for construction of infrastructure
@piersmorgan: jeb bush was as ineffectual as ever. as always @david gergen calls it right: trump held them off. #gopdebate
@piersmorgan: trump won that debate. people can huff & puff all they like but he was the best candidate on the night. #gopdebate

i am in new hampshire having a great time! loved the #gopdebate last night! everybody enjoy the super bowl. #superbowlsunday #sb50
so far the super bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - make america great again!
my two wonderful sons don and eric will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! enjoy.
jeb bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a super bowl ad. he is a weak candidate!
thank you for your support at this mornings town hall- in salem new hampshire. #fitn #nhprimary
jeb bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #commoncore and very weak on illegal immigration.
everybody is laughing at jeb bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. a pathetic figure!
america needs strong leadership. politicians can talk but they dont get things done. video:
today's third stop- londonderry new hampshire! thank you!#fitn #votetrumpnh
now that bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super pacs. sad!
#votetrumpnh #nhprimary #fitn
thank you new hampshire! #fitn #nhprimary #votetrumpnh voting questions?
thank you new hampshire! #fitn
remember @jebbush wants common core education from d.c. and is very weak on illegal immigration come as act of love . not a leader!
i know the governors and jeb bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot. his family used private eminent domain!
no-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. i have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
the polls are now showing that i am the best to win the general election. states that are never in play for repubs will be won by me. great!
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. a.m. enjoy!
make america great again!

thank you to the people of new hampshire i love you! now off to south carolina.
@markhalperin: my report card grades for the 2 new hampshire winners: donaldtrump a: v strong energy close. berniesanders b : went too long
dopey mort zuckerman owner of the worthless @nydailynews has a major inferiority complex. paper will close soon!
worthless @nydailynews which dopey mort zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer! liabilities are massive!
like the worthless @nydailynews looks like @politico will be going out of business. bad reporting- no money no cred!
such a great experience in new hampshire - amazing people! will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today.
so funny jeb bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer - i assume that is a compliment!
big speech tonight in south carolina - 7:00 p.m. tremendous crowd!
i was referring to the fact that jeb bush wants to keep common core.
@haryder: which is it @realdonaldtrump ?are you planning on getting rid of common core or keeping it? get rid of it fast.
thank you- clemson south carolina! #makeamericagreatagain #scprimary
i have been consistent in my opposition to common core. get rid of common core--- keep education local!
there are no buyers for the worthless @nydailynews but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking. it is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
jeb bush spent more than $40000000 in new hampshire to come in 4 or 5 i spent $3000000 to come in 1st. big difference in capability!
.@markhalperin showed a focus group on @morning joe me using a very bad word. i never said the word left an open blank. please apologize!
remember it was the republican party with the help of conservatives that made so many promises to their base but didn't keep them! hi dt
he or she who hesitates is lost: make america great again!
jeb failed as jeb! he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother who got us into the quicksand of iraq . spent $120 million.weak-no chance!
we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. we are watching!
heading to baton rouge louisiana for a speech. expecting a very large crowd! see you soon. #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain
@truthinvest: @cnn @tedcruz @realdonaldtrump ted cruz is the definition of sleaze. just ask @realbencarson
cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w @realbencarson. how can he preach christian values?
just landed in baton rouge louisiana. reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. wow! #makeamericagreatagain
thank you- baton rouge louisiana! we will #makeamericagreatagain! #trump2016
weak jeb getting thrown out by management during speech. do you think he will be this tough on putin & others?
lying cruz put out a statement trump & rubio are w obama on gay marriage. cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest. perhaps all 3?
how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
nevada! tomorrow is the deadline to register republican.visit: from @ivankatrump:
the failing @nydailynews destroyed by little morty zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online. it's dead!
you must be registered republican by february 16th to vote trump in the florida primary.
nothing conservative about the club for growth coming into my office and demanding a $1m contribution which naturally they did not get.
after hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1m from me they went hostile w a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.
lightweight @jebbush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc. false advertising- desperate and sad!
if @tedcruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads i have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
last time lightweight @jebbush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. if he doesn't do better this time he is out!
@hillx123: @tedcruz you have just been put on notice @realdonaldtrump we stand with you... #makeamericagreatagain thankyou.
@by @tedcruz good i want to see the court decide what i was always told natural born means - born on american soil
@copyover2001: @realdonaldtrump do americans really want a canadian-born president? first non native born in history?
millions of $'s of false ads paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @sentedcruz and sleepy @jebbush are now running in s.c.
#makeamericagreatagain!
i will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! we need to make america safe & great again! #trump2016

i am the only one who can fix this. very sad. will not happen under my watch! #makeamericagreatagain
@jd4160: nice column by bill donahue head of catholic league. he's a blue collar new yorker and gets it

love the people of south carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
the totally unexpected loss of supreme court justice antonin scalia is a massive setback for the conservative movement and our country!
wow! honored to be chosen by the highly respected accurate washington & lee mock convention. i hope you are right - i will make you proud!
nasty ted cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w @realbencarson- saying i may not be on ballot & i hold liberal positions. lies!
ted cruz is a cheater! he holds the bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
on the way to the #gopdebate with my wonderful wife @melaniatrump.
lightweight @jebbush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in texas- lie! #gopdebate
thank you! i miss my father.
how can @jebbush beat hillary clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #gopdebate stage with $150m? i am the only one who can!
all polls have me winning debate big- drudge time etc. dopey charles krauthammer still nasty. he has zero cred- totally dishonest!
#makeamericagreatagain!
hey @glennbeck- see how i beat your boy ted- in your own blaze poll? your endorsement means nothing! #gopdebate
#gopdebate #googletrends
@jeffpaine: @realdonaldtrump you crushed the debate! thank you!
even though every poll time drudge etc. has me winning the debate by a lot @foxnews only puts negative people on. biased - a total joke!
@autumnandews08: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush jeb is incompetent and will lose don't waste your energy on that cry baby!
this shows what a complete & total liar ted cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated john roberts. really?
i will be on face the nation with john dickerson on cbs this morning. enjoy!
thank you for your support! together we will make america great again!
loved the debate last night and almost everyone said i won but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. all donors & special ints
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!
wow in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties! thank you!
ted cruz along with jeb bush pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court. roberts could have killed obamacare twice but didn't!
funny that jeb ! didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.then mommy now brother!
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates hillary would destroy them. ted may not be eligible to run - born in canada
i will be in south carolina all week. saturday is big big big! get out and vote - make america great again
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb ! is he fair game for questions about world trade center iraq war and eco collapse? careful!
i'd like to call jeb a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used eminent domain- when criticizing me! 1 2
jeb used eminent domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. 2 2
jeb is a hypocrite! used massive private eminent domain --- just another clueless politician!
response to the lies of senator cruz: #votetrumpsc

explain to @brithume and @megynkelly who know nothing that i will beat hillary and win states and dem-indie votes that no other r can!
.@brithume thinks that when republicans drop out of the race someone will pick up all of that vote. the fact is i will get much of it!
@good2bqueen67: @brithume @megynkelly they're too lame to get it sir. when you win the election they'll get it.
thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! we are doing really well in south carolina. @cnn @donlemon
@debdew2: @brithume @megynkelly @diamondandsilk fox: trump haters r scared because they lose - trump is winning
why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative? without me her ratings would tank. get a life megyn!
@babo sirin: busted again: @tedcruz in hot water over possibly illegal fundraising #scprimary the guy is bad news
@chjluc91: @yomasterjon @richardtburnett scary how smoothly cruz looks into the camera and lies about trump cant be #potus! #trump2016
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president - this from perhaps the worst president in u.s. history!
.@lindseygraham who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @foxnews.
i will beat hillary easily but lindsey graham says i won't and yet he got zero against me- no cred! why does fox put him on?
.@foxnews is so biased it is disgusting. they do not want trump to win. all negative!
just out nevada poll shows jeb bush at 1 he should take his dumb mouthpiece @lindseygrahamsc and just go home.
jeb bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. he wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1 in nevada!

amazing that while i lead by big numbers in the new q and and usa today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony wsj nbc poll.
the just out usa today national poll where i lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup i beat both hillary and bernie.
i love being in south carolina. we are leading big in all of the state polls - saturday is a big day. make america great again!
new cbs national poll just out - massive lead for trump. the wall street journal nbc poll is a total joke. no wonder wsj is doing so badly!

i was asked about healthcare by anderson cooper & have been consistent- i will repeal all of #obamacare including the mandate period.
i was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. i will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w something much better.
i will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. maximum choice & freedom for consumer.
im self-funding and i am going to take care of the people not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
remember cruz and bush gave us roberts who upheld #obamacare twice! i am the only one who will #makeamericagreatagain!

hopefully others will follow suit. our country needs & should demand security. it is time to get tough & be smart!
boycott all apple products until such time as apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical islamic terrorist couple from cal

many people are now saying i won south carolina because of the last debate. i showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!
thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr! #bikersfortrump #votetrumpnv video:
it is so important to audit the federal reserve and yet ted cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
wow ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director. more dirty tricks!
ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. take ad down ted. biggest liar in politics!
ted cruz has now apologized to marco rubio and ben carson for fraud and dirty tricks. no wonder he has lost evangelical support!
just saw the phony ad by cruz - totally false more dirty tricks. he got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
ted cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in iowa. weak rnc and republican leadership probably won't let this happen! sad.
i will be on @seanhannity tonight- from las vegas nevada at 10pme. enjoy! #hannity #trump2016

a big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. a total waste of time to watch boring and biased. @brithume said i would never run a dope!

thank you las vegas nevada!#nevadacaucus #votetrumpnv
ted cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in s.c. he is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
wow was ted cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. he used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! ted panicked.
ted cruz does not have the right temperment to be president. look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. bad!
ted cruz lifts the bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! the evangelicals in s.c. figured him out & said no!
@vogelsong1: @edrollins gets it. was just on @foxnews explaining how trump wins the general election. thank you ed!
@jojo2foxy: trump is unstoppable....he is what common sense americans want whether republican independent or a reagan democrat.
i am growing the republican party tremendously - just look at the numbers way up! democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
@stevenmeyers11: @vogelsong1 @edrollins @foxnews ed rollins is the only one of those people that understands process & gets it right

mitt romneywho totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy
@ward ii: oh great @mittromney is doing a @senatorreid on @realdonaldtrump like losing the presidency wasn't enough #trump2016 he's a fool
when mitt romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
why would texans vote for liar ted cruz when he was born in canada lived there for 4 years-and remained a canadian citizen until recently
when ted cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear i will get most of his votes - no problem!
.@repchriscollins chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. i will not let you down! @cnn
@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump this texan will be voting trump march 1st. cruz is a fake texan!

@conservativevin: @ahernandez85a romney should have been a tough guy with obama. he cowered and lost. badly! he's not relevant!
@classyexplorer: @ahernandez85a romney is a pawn of the establishment and has no individual thought process. he is jealous of trump!
@chatteringteef: @borntobegop @realdonaldtrump @mittromney hates to see trump's success when he was so pathetic
great new poll. thank you texas! #votetrump #makeamericagreatagain
mitt romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns. dope!
why doesnt @mittromney just endorse @marcorubio already.should have done it before nh or nevada where he had a little sway. too latenow!
just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w someones net worth. i have already filed my financial statements w fec. they are great!
signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?

fmr pres of mexico vicente fox horribly used the f word when discussing the wall. he must apologize! if i did that there would be a uproar!
thank you! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016

@waltseher: @realdonaldtrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not trump
i will be making a speech at 12:00 in fort worth texas. really big crowd expected. will be talking about the debate last night-plus plus!

why would the people of florida vote for marco rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their senator and then quit!
will be at fort worth texas convention center at 11:30 a.m. big crowd - get there early! big announcement to be made!
lying ted cruz and lightweight choker marco rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. they failed!
lightweight choker marco rubio looks like a little boy on stage. not presidential material!
wow every poll said i won the debate last night. great honor!
lightweight marco rubio was working hard last night. the problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! mr. meltdown.
they don't like rubio in florida- he left them high & dry. doesn't even show up for votes!

i unfairly get audited by the i.r.s. almost every single year. i have rich friends who never get audited. i wonder why?
tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. after the audit no problem!
i am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight rubio or ted cruz!
fun to watch the democrats working so hard to win the great state of south carolina when i just won the republican version - amazing people!
i only wish my wonderful father fred gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight rubio says. he didn't - total fabrication!
i started my business with very little and built it into a great company with some of the best real estate assets in the world. amazing!
.#rogerstone was just banned by @cnn - their loss! tough loyal guy.
just watched lightweight marco rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. he is not as smart as cruz and may be an even bigger liar

keep lightweight marco and his friends out of the white house. #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
another dishonest politician #lightweightsenatormarcorubio

great news! thank you governor ralph dlg torres! #trump2016
i just got off the phone with the great people of guam! thank you for your support! #votetrump today! #trump2016
the organized group of people many of them thugs who shut down our first amendment rights in chicago have totally energized america!
absentee governor kasich voted for nafta and nafta devastated ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. kasich is good for mexico!
ohio had the biggest budget increase in the u.s. if it were not for striking oil they would be bust! governor kasich in favor of tpp fraud!
the rally in cincinnati is on. media put out false reports that it was cancelled. will be great - love you ohio!
on my way to dayton ohio. will be there soon!
make america great again!
thank you dayton ohio! 20000 supporters- largest in airport history! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
the rally in cincinnati is on. media put out false reports that it was cancelled! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
word is-early voting in fl is very dishonest. little marco his state chairman & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
we are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in florida- on behalf of little marco rubio. no way to run a country!
the last person that hillary or bernie want to run against is donald trump --- and that is fact!
it is clinton and sanders people who disrupted my rally in chicago - and then they say i must talk to my people. phony politicians!
just finished my second speech. 20k in dayton & 25k in cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. thanks- i love you ohio!
#endcommoncore #trump2016video:
do the people of ohio know that john kasich is strongly in favor of common core! in other words education of your children from d.c. no way
usss did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. he has ties to isis. should be in jail!
wow kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of pennsylvania not enough signatures. big problem!
@alextrent4: it is repulsive that trump was assaulted politicians used that 2 further themselves 2 further victimize trump! disgusting!!
bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. be careful bernie or my supporters will go to yours!
ohio gov.kasich voted for nafta from which ohio has never recovered. now he wants tpp which will be even worse. ohio steel and coal dying!
gov.kasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television he only watches the @golfchannel
thank you kevin. with unification of the party republican wins will be massive!
carly fiorina- i agree! ted cruz is just another politician. all talk- no action!
because gov. kasich cannot run in the state of pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in ohio on tue.
the failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. they knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. really bad people!
lyin' ted
just received from @peterose 14. thank you pete! #votetrump on tuesday ohio! #trump2016#makeamericagreatagain
we don't have a country- if we don't have borders. #votetrump video:
look forward to being in tampa this afternoon. wonderful crowds. thank you florida!
leaving the great people of north carolina. amazing event. heading to tampa now! #votetrump
gov kasich voted for nafta which devastated ohio and is now pushing tpp hard- bad for american workers!
kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in ohio. i will bring them back! #makeamericagreatagain
thank you - youngstown ohio! i love you! get out & #votetrump tomorrow. #trump2016
sadly this kind of stuff even happened to ronald reagan. there is nothing nice about it! #makeamericagreatagain
@brazielcarol: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump who started this mess the protesters of course . and media made it worse.
@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews i believe that @realdonaldtrump will be the big winner tomorrow. thank you!
@wh: wow people are so misinformed on donaldtrump character! watch this video! hillary and bernie don't come close
@mazzei48: @realdonaldtrump @brazielcarol @foxnews listening to interview on replay of @a savage nation #go donald trump !!!!! thanks.
kasich voted for nafta a disaster for ohio and now wants the even worse tpp approved. vote trump and end this madness!
rubio is weak on illegal immigration with the worst voting record in the u.s. senate in many years. he will never make america great again!
i will bring our jobs back to america fix our military and take care of our vets end common core and obamacare protect 2nd a build wall
please remember i am the only candidate who is self-funding his campaign. kasich rubio and cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
don't reward mitt romney who let us all down in the last presidential race by voting for kasich who voted for nafta open borders etc. .
good morning ohio! some additional information from my daughter @ivankatrump! #votetrump #supertuesday
just in big news- i have been declared the winner of the cnmi rep caucus with 72.8 of the vote! thank you! #supertuesday #votetrump
north carolina lost 300000 manufacturing jobs and ohio lost 400000 since 2000. going to mexico etc. no more if i win we will bring back!
#votetrump #supertuesdayfloridaillinoismissourinorth carolinaohio #trumptrain
watching john kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. remember him in second debate until i put him down.
ohio is losing jobs to mexico now losing ford and many others . kasich is weak on illegal immigration. we need strong borders now!
in presidential voting so far john kasich is zero for 22. so why would he be a good candidate? hillary would beat him i will beat hillary!
i will bring our jobs back to the u.s. and keep our companies from leaving. nobody else can do it. our economy will sing again.
a lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in florida? hope this is false.
word is that despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads i had a massive victory in florida. numbers out soon!
@bertshad: was going to watch @foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly - looks like #cnn tonight
@gregens21: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly she's choking on the results! call her justifiable kelly. justifying everything she says.
@jsconlon11: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly i tried to give them a shot tonight but they have the whole anti trump cheerleading team.
@j styborski: @realdonaldtrump @gregens21 @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly hayes is looking depressed as well.
@scnak45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realdonaldtrump it's ridiculous don't worry everyone is wise to crazy megyn!
@dumpfoxnews: @foxnews @megynkelly if media wasn't so biased against trump he would've won all of the delegates.
can't watch crazy megyn anymore. talks about me at 43 but never mentions that there are four people in race. with two people big & over!
thank you northern mariana islands!#supertuesday #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain
thank you florida! #supertuesday #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
watching other networks and local news. really good night! crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable.

@foxbusiness: .@reptommarino: i think @realdonaldtrump can beat hillaryclinton. and i'm looking forward to trump being president.
.@reptommarino great job on television this morning. glad to have you on my side!
is this what we want for a president?
yesterday was amazing5 victories. lyin ted cruzhad zero. things are going very well!
in the last 2 weeks i had $35m of negative ads against me in florida & i won in a massive landslide.the establishment should save their $$!
thank you to the governor of florida rick scott for your endorsement. i greatly appreciate your support!
i am making a big speech the night of the @foxnews debate but i wish everyone well. yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!
wow just won missouri!
thank you missouri! #trump2016
i will be interviewed on the o'reilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel. @oreillyfactor
stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of mitt romney's historic loss is now telling the republican party what to do with trump. sad!
crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night. ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. ted can't win!
great news that @foxnews has cancelled the additional debate. how many times can the same people ask the same question? i beat cruz debating
crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.tough!
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
.@wsj editorial says clinton primary vote total is 8646551.trump's is 7533692 -a knock. but she had only 3 opponents-i had 16.apologize
.@wsj is bad at math. the good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me!
please explain to the dummies at the @wsj editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc. all 11 of them!
see you in arizona on friday and saturday.
looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio. two more days and ohio was mine!
highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. focus on others megyn!
who should star in a reboot of liar liar- hillary clinton or ted cruz? let me know.
make america great again!
hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
join us in salt lake city utah- tonight!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
lyin' ted cruz lost all five races on tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a lindsey graham endorsement. also backed jeb. lindsey got 0!
senator @lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about @sentedcruz and then he endorsed him. no wonder nobody trusts politicians!
.@ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstateand now he is the one leading opposition against me.
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up. can anyone explain this?
club for growth tried to extort $1000000 from me. when i said no they went hostile with negative ads. disgraceful!
club for growth letter- trying to extort $1000000.00 from me. remember i said- no!
going to salt lake city utah for a big rally. lyin' ted cruz should not be allowed to win there - mormons don't like liars! i beat hillary
failed presidential candidate mitt romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing lyin' ted cruz. this is good for me!
failed presidential candidate mitt romney was campaigning with john kasich & marco rubio and now he is endorsing ted cruz. 1 2
mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. no wonder he lost!
join me tomorrow! #trump2016#makeamericagreatagain
thank you arizona- i love you! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. never worth watching. always a hit on trump! she is sick & the most overrated person on tv.
do you believe that hillary clinton now wants obamacare for illegal immigrants? she should spend more time taking care of our great vets!
i guess i have reached yet another ceiling - 49.7 with four people. my highest reuters poll yet! thank you!
why haven't they released the final missouri victory for us yet? could it be because cruz's guy runs missouri?
just leaving salt lake city utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. love utah- will be back!
watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show! has very interesting take on paul ryan.
heading to phoneix. will be arriving soon. tomorrow a big day. tremendous crowds expected! #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain
while i have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times i consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!
reading @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!
landing in phoenix now. tomorrow's events will be amazing! #trump2016
thank you- new york! i love you!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
@ileanabarkus: @nytdavidbrooks i totally agree! @nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has no commonsense!
@cmichaeld2004: realistic trump poll numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two-man race. gee what happened to that 30 ceiling
@wesleyrickard: sheriff joe arpaio az endorses donald j trump for president of the united states #az #ut
@veteran4trump: vets for a strong america endorses donald trump for president we've endorsed him we believe in him #trump2016
@grammy620: 1st time i heard #trump i said wow . i liked him! i then became a closet #trump fan. today? he's the only 1 i will vote for!
@ashleyedam: it's great to see supporters like you along the way...watching americans come together the past 8 months #votetrump
@ma1973sk: actually no @foxnews @megynkelly has a sick obsession with trump. every day every show trashing negative hate.
@donaldjtrumpjr: honored to be in #utah with retired general robert c. oaks. we are so thankful for his support and endorsement here in slc
@teamtrumpaz: check out hannity exclusive event with trump in phoenix az @eventbrite
@saneplanet: after tonight it is clear! utah is #trumpcountry #utah #mormon #utahprimary #utah4trump
crazy @megynkelly says i don't won't go on her show and she still gets good ratings. but almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!
if crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank. she is so average in so many ways!
great to be back in arizona!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
wow @cnn ratings are up 75 because it's all trump all the time. the networks are making a fortune off of me! make america great again!
thank you arizona! 20000 amazing supporters! get out and #votetrump on tuesday. i love you!#makeamericagreatagain

thank you arizona! get out and #votetrump on tuesday! #azprimary #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
@jojo2foxy: trump is not afraid of anything or anyone - that's the president usa needs to unite us & knock the socks off our enemies!
the rallies in utah and arizona were great! tremendous crowds and spirit. just returned but will be going back soon.
@gstephanopoulos: whats @realdonaldtrump's strategy to secure the gop nomination? ill talk to the republican front-runner. @thisweekabc.
will be interviewed on @thisweekabc this morning. enjoy!
why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roads doors during my rallies are never blamed by media? sad!
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters!
so the highly overrated anchor @megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i can't fight back? wrong!
@gamzorz: @megynkelly dont worry trump they are losing thousands of viewers and money. roger ailes will be telling megyn to stop
big republican dinner tonight at mar-a-lago in palm beach. i will be there!
wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him. he greeted pope and others. no respect
@barrong510: @realdonaldtrump the media is corrupt! we the people are fighting with you.
@mypresidentme: here's trump #aipac2016 in case anyone missed it. it is a must watch.
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was. not anymore it is from a different world! u.s. must be vigilant and smart!
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels. he is being treated badly!
make america great again!
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and its not even close. hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today!
watch this clip from earlier this year. time & time again i have been right about terrorism. its time to get tough!
my heart & prayers go out to all of the victims of the terrible #brussels tragedy. this madness must be stopped and i will stop it.

#arizonaprimary message from @ivankatrump! #azprimary #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
#utahcaucus message from @ivankatrump! #utcaucus#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! shame.
pres. obama should leave the baseball game in cuba immediately & get home to washington- where a #potus under a serious emergency belongs!
lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a g.q. shoot in his ad. be careful lyin' ted or i will spill the beans on your wife!
incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and open-and let the muslims flow in. no way!
thank you arizona! #trump2016#westerntuesday #trumptrain
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona. thank you i will never forget!
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices!
lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the g.q. model photo post of melania. that's why we call him lyin' ted!
thank you arizona! #trump2016#makeamericagreatagain #trumptrain
lyin ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician.
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin ted cruz. honestly i cant blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion!
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
i will be the best by far in fighting terror. im the only one that was right from the beginning & now lyin ted & others are copying me.
i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted. jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing. i spent a fraction of that and am first!
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
i want to thank @realsheriffjoe for all of his help in our historic arizona win. could not have done it without you joe!
make america great again!
@debrarakestraw: you have over 2m followers more than than @hillaryclinton. this says something about how america feels. #trump2016
@tcsorr: @jphilman0206 @realdonaldtrump self-funded and media loves him. not beholden to masters like @tedcruz. who owns ted?
@kj11100me: @realdonaldtrump donald trump will be greater president than ragan. trump will set the button for moralitychristianity.
@don vito 08: a picture is worth a thousand words @realdonaldtrump #lyingted #nevercruz @melaniatrump
n.a.t.o. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of n.a.t.o. why? it is time to renegotiate and the time is now!
@missi51: .@realdonaldtrump thank god is not a politician but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people.
it is amazing how @lindseygrahamsc gets on so many t.v. shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run!
.@lindseygrahamsc and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - all talk and no action! both talk about isis do nothing!
these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. i was so right!
it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media. illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato!
@timvincent56: @lindseygrahamsc talkers think about the future doers are already building it #votetrump2016
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. time for a change i will solve - and fast!
.@theview t.v. show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on. i tell them no
explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time
@doctor s freud: @theview they're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. i say you go on and destroy them all a dead show
just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe. also many in u.s. i told you so! i alone can fix this problem!
europe and the u.s. must immediately stop taking in people from syria. this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! so sad!
@neilturner : @realdonaldtrump cruz & rubio are scared! watch -
endorsements for lyin' ted cruz-
make america great again!
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it. if i lost-monster story!
i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did. he knew the pac was putting it out - hence lyin' ted!
wow just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. how am i still number one - by a lot?
@11phenomenon: #lyingted blames @realdonaldtrump for so many things i am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis.
top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking. weak leaders ridiculous laws!
@theageofleo: your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined.
@stancoltrane: turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realdonaldtrump had nothing to do with it
@spartanmaker: let me help you trumpophobes with math: trump: $10.3b-$1.2m 74' equity 1.2m 858233 . s&p: 1314.5 #derp
@tytan01: dear @cnn after doing a quick google & twitter search there are over 15000 women's groups supporting donaldtrump. stop lying.
@pattiandsammi: @gullakhta99 @realdonaldtrump @tytan01 @cnn women love trump. trump's execs predominantly female. #women4trump
the media is so after me on women wow this is a tough business. nobody has more respect for women than donald trump!
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite!
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enq.were caused by me. i had nothing to do with story!
nobody will protect our nation like donald j. trump. our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. illegals out!
wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in u.s. jobs are leaving. i will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs
don't believe the @foxnews polls they are just another phony hit job on me. i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election.
remember i am the only candidate who is self-funding. while i am given little credit for this by the voters i am not bought like others!
i am interviewed on this week on @abc this morning. enjoy!
wow sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. he is do totally biased. the things i am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others
my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the u.s. are now finally receiving plaudits!
happy easter to all have a great day!
another radical islamic attack this time in pakistan targeting christian women & children. at least 67 dead400 injured. i alone can solve
why can't the pundits be honest? hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. i will make it strong and great! jobs!
just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz-lawsuit coming
see lyin' ted even the @dailybeast no fan of mine says this story came from rubio not trump!
the united states cannot continue to make such bad one-sided trade deals. there are only so many jobs we can give up. no more!
@victorconkle: #wiprimary @realdonaldtrump will defeat isis and #makeamericagreatagain
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. things are looking good had a great easter-look forward to spending the week in wisconsin!
@nellalda: @realdonaldtrump we stand by trump 100 thank you!
kirsten powers: anti- trump operative was aggressively shopping cruz story via the gateway pundit:
a detainee released from gitmo has killed an american. when will our so-called leaders ever learn!
ted cruz is incensed that i want to refocus nato on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to pay fair share a must!
@wolfblitzer: campaign-to-date popular gop totals: @realdonaldtrump 7546980 @tedcruz 5481737 @johnkasich 2724749 a big difference
just released that international gangs are all over our cities. this will end when i am president!
@pauladuvall2: cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. if you're for motherhood he'll be against it!
after the way i beat gov. scott walker and jeb rand marco and all others in the presidential primaries no way he would ever endorse me!
lyin'ted cruz is weak & losing big so now he wants to debate again. but according to drudgetime and on-line polls i have won all debates
lyin' ted i have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. you should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
we need to secure our borders asap. no games we must be smart tough and vigilant. make america great again & make america strong again!
wow @cnn has nothing but my opponents on their shows. really one-sided and unfair reporting. maybe i shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
i have millions more votes hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc.
how come the @todayshow & @chucktodd show the new @nbcnews poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz?
wow corey lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter. look at tapes-nothing there!
why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
victory press conference was over. why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? can i press charges?
this was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune.
why is this reporter touching me as i leave news conference? what is in her hand??
make america great again!
thank you! #makeamericagreatagain
trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:

the club for growthwhich asked me for $1000000 in an extortion attempt just put up a wisconsin ad with incorrect math.what a dumb group!
the club for growth said in their ad that 465 delegates cruz plus 143 delegates kasich is more than my 739 delegates. try again!
the national border patrol council nbpc said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the american people!
for the 1st time in american history americas 16500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsementme! thank you.

is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but donald trump on her terrible show. she totally misrepresents my words and positions! bad.

i will be in wisconsin until the election. jobs trade and immigration will be big factors. i will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade but if i win all of the bad things happening in the u.s. will be rapidly reversed!

i'll be in one of my favorite places this morning staten island. big crowd will be fun!
lyin' ted cruz will never be able to beat hillary. despite a rigged delegate system i am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
lyin' ted cruz can't get votes i am millions ahead of him so he has to get his delegates from the republican bosses. it won't work!
crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. i am the one person she doesn't want to run against. will be such fun!
i would have millions of votes more than hillary except for the fact that i had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named bernie!
thank you california! will see you soon! #makeamericagreatagain
thank you for today's endorsement new york veteran police association! #newyorkvalues
@diamondandsilk: .@realdonaldtrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted rigged system. 4 no profit under budget & ahead of schedule.
lyin' ted cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-i am millions of votes ahead! hillary would destroy him & k
kasich only looks o.k. in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him
new york we will make america great again!
lyin ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september 11th help. so many new yorkers devastated. cruz hates new york!

senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race. he said kasich should get out for same reason. i think both should get out!
both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory. they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify!
cruz said kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. now he can't get to 1237. drop out lyin' ted.
i met prince on numerous occasions. he was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. he will be greatly missed!

@newtgingrich: #nyprimary turned trump from frontrunner into presumptive #gop nominee
@diamondandsilk: .@donaldjtrumpjr awesome job on @cnnsotu. donaldtrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call delegate bribery
i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. becoming irrelevant!
wow just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination. desperation!
lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. sad!
lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one. shows weakness!
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him. typical politician - can't make a deal work.
on the way to the great state of rhode island- big rally. then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night!

happy #cincodemayo! the best taco bowls are made in trump tower grill. i love hispanics!
bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democratsboth with delegates & otherwise. he should show them & run as an independent.
join me tomorrow! #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain omaha nebraska: oregon:
can you believe crooked hillary said we are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business. she then apologized.
thank you west virginia. let's keep it going. go out and vote on tuesday - we will win big. #trump2016
unlike crooked hillary clinton who wants to destroy all miners i want wages to go up in america. we will do so by bringing back jobs!
governor rick perry said donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency i've ever seen. thank you rick!
so many great endorsements yesterday except for paul ryan! we must put america first and make america great again!
@ausbiz: many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #makeamericagreatagain #trumptrain
paul ryan said that i inherited something very special the republican party. wrong i didn't inherit it i won it with millions of voters!
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability. as bernie sanders says she has bad judgement. constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
thank you to teachers across america! when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed then john kasich and that didn't work. not much power or insight!
i hear @joenbc of rapidly fading @morning joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. this will guarantee a crooked hillary win.
response to @lindseygrahamsc:
i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate. i will defeat them both.
lets properly check goofy elizabeth warrens records to see if she is native american. i say shes a fraud!
goofy elizabeth warren hillary clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. she is not native american.
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska. sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.
crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders. millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me.
goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant. she is too easy! i'm driving her nuts.
goofy elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective. does nothing. all talk no action -- maybe her native american name?
join me in washington today!spokane tickets: tickets:
i am going to keep our jobs in the u.s. and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. crooked hillary has no clue! @teamsters
i am honored that the great men and women of the @teamsters have created a movement from within called teamsters for trump! thank you.
remember when the two failed presidential candidates lindsey graham and jeb bush signed a binding pledge? they broke the deal no honor!
.@edgoeas thank you for your support tonight on @judgejeanine.
@matandsher: i want a leader that will shoot straight with us. the politicians can't. @realdonaldtrump will give his all for us!

i will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning. enjoy!
.@kellyannepolls kellyanne you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. keep going - i will win for the people. make america great again!
crooked hillary just can't close the deal with bernie. it will be the same way with isis and china on trade and mexico at the border. bad!
on @seanhannity show @foxnews now. enjoy!
i will win the election against crooked hillary despite the people in the republican party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
i will be interviewed on @newday @cnn at 7:00 a.m.
@mathewjmari: on @facethenation #mattschlapp was on the ball & #jenniferrubin is in a time warped stupor. @realdonaldtrump will expand #gop

i will be interviewed on @cnn at 7:00 a.m.
wow i hear @morning joe has gone really hostile ever since i said i won't do or watch the show anymore.they misrepresent my positions!
@richbooth6: @realdonaldtrump @cnn good interview mr. trump. you set the facts straight. thank you.
will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @foxbizalert at 7:30 a.m. enjoy!
@nathandwilsonfl: @mariabartiromo you had a great interview with donald today! i started watching your show due to donald trump.
@daybastrop @foxandfriends @bretbaier the liars that signed the pledge and now won't support @realdonaldtrump is the reason they are losers
@valdosta monkey: @chriscuomo @realdonaldtrump is chris serious lying or misinformed? bill clinton signed nafta
#wvprimary #votetrump #trump2016
#neprimary #votetrump #trump2016
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump. but i had 17 people to beatshe had one!
if i only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton i would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
thank you jason greenblatt @jasondovesq for our children: let's elect donald trump
@redrising11: i am a woman & i just voted for @realdonaldtrump #nebraskaprimary #trump2016 #trumpforpresident
get out and vote west virginia we will make america great again!
get out and vote nebraska we will make america great again!
. #repmikekelly great job on @foxandfriends this morning. thank you for the nice words!
why does the media with a strong push from crooked hillary keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes. exactly opposite!
it was rosie o'donnell who ate the cake in the vicious hillary commercial about me not crooked hillary! @marthamaccallum
it is only the people that were never asked to be vp that tell the press that they will not take the position.
nebraska #votetrump today!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016

thank you nebraska!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
big wins in west virginia and nebraska. get ready for november - crooked hillary who is looking very bad against crazy bernie will lose!
i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary. his time will come!
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire u.s. senate. she has done nothing!
goofy elizabeth warren didnt have the guts to run for potus. her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold.
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
thanks piers.
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been she would lose!
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked hillary. see her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you
our native american senator goofy elizabeth warren couldnt care less about the american workerdoes nothing to help!
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage. see mediaasking for increase!
isnt it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump & gets nothing done in senate?
in interview i told @ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election!
if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren wed have no jobs in americashe doesnt have a clue.
great day in d.c. with @speakerryan and republican leadership. things working out really well! #trump2016
great meeting with @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and republican leaders in d.c. #trump2016
senator lindsey graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more!
.@thehill your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrectit is just the opposite. i will not support or endorse a carbon tax!
an incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person ihave such tremendous respect for. thank you sheldon!
if crooked hillary clinton can't close the deal on crazy bernie how is she going to take on china russia isis and all of the others?
great new poll- thank you!
wow @cnn is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible. very unprofessional. hurting in ratings - bad television!
@stranahan: sheldon adelson pledges $100 million to elect trump president - breitbart
thank you for the nice words this morning @kellyriddell. well delivered and totally logical! @cnn @foxnews
the failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women they found nothing. a joke!
@queencharlotteo: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes i'm a women & i 100 support @realdonaldtrump & i have since the beginning. thank you!
@mrtohney: leicester & donaldtrump seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights. history?
@distlerjoyce: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes ohio women for trump
everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.i gave them many names of women i helped-refused to use
@tzard000: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes everyone continues to pile onto donald but they can never take away our votes! thank you!
@takingit back: @nytimes keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #trump2016 thanks.
why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women? the media is totally dishonest!
wow i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. massive front page for that!
why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers. dishonest!
the media is really on a witch-hunt against me. false reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
thank you georgia! see you soon!#trump2016
the @washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong. marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration.
great new poll- thank you!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems. the system is rigged against him. he should run as an independent! run bernie run.
that was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
the @nytimes is so dishonest. their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer who said it was a lie!
wow rowanne brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday was on @foxandfriends saying times lied
a political commentator for @cnn which i no longer watch said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries. i set all-time record!
with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud!
thank you anthony @scaramucci @wsj the entrepreneur's case for trump
rowanne brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.
the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
no wonder the @nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false malicious & libelous story they did on me.
over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. thats because there were so many positive statements.
the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes michael barbaro who was interviewed on cbs this morning was unable to respond.
in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue. this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in u.s. history!
i gave a woman named barbara res a top n.y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. so much for a nice thank you!
what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. i said no.
@aprillajune: oregon votes today! go vote for @realdonaldtrump and kick it big time!
wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton. she said they had to do with a wedding reception. liar! how can she run?
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. you can tell them to go blank themselves - was about china not women!
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women. can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! my hit was on china
oregon is voting today. keep the big numbers going - vote trump! make america great again!
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in u.s. political history
crooked hillary can't close the deal with bernie sanders. will be another bad day for her!
#votetrump at clerk's offices & 185 ballot drop boxes in #orprimary!closes at 8pm!
crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.if so he should runnot her.will he bring the energizer to d.c.?
how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta the worst economic deal in u.s. history?
i look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight 8 pm et. it will be interesting to see how she treats mei think she will be very fair.
i will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the fox network tonight at 8! enjoy!
do you think crooked hillary will finally close the deal? if she can't win kentucky she should drop out of race. system rigged!
wall street paid for ad is a fraud just like crooked hillary! their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. apologize?
i will be live tweeting @megynkelly show in 10 minutes. should be interesting. will be on fox network! enjoy!

@cowboysfortrump: @christichat @rockprincess818 @realdonaldtrump that man is a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president
i can't believe that @cnn would allow the very nice jeffrey lord to be savaged by a panel of seven trump haters. 7 to 1 - don't watch cnn!
i look so forward to debating crooked hillary clinton! democrat primaries are rigged e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
@michael favreau: @jis3 @realdonaldtrump he will destroy hillary but why give cnn record breaking ratings cnn can go to hell. trump 2016
michael barbaro the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women has in past tweeted badly about me. he should resign
@sandrajeanne48: no way i believe trump at 70 disapproval with women. went to 3 rallies. at least 1 2 women. msm lies @thefive
@loudobbs: hillary just handed @realdonaldtrump a huge gift: promising to put bubba in charge of the economy! #makeamericagreatagain!
thank you oregon! #trump2016 #makeamericagreatagain
congratulations to the movement we have just won the great state of oregon. the vote percentage is even higher than anticipated! thank you.
@magicmetalninja: the trump movement will not be stopped. we support trump because he is a true american looking out for #americafirst.
@shoneep: @realdonaldtrump trump for president! bernie is a joke knows nothing - and hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare
paul begala the dopey @cnn flunky and head of the pro-hillary clinton super pac has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the democrats - the system is rigged against him. many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
why did clinton supporter @alisonforky declare crooked hillary winner in ky when ap hasn't even called the race?
thank you arizona! see you soon!#makeamericagreatagain
thank you louisiana! #trump2016
#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016
some low-life journalist claims that i made a pass at her 29 years ago. never happened! like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
my list of potential u.s. supreme court justices was very well recieved. during the next number of weeks i may be adding to the list!
looks like yet another terrorist attack. airplane departed from paris. when will we get tough smart and vigilant? great hate and sickness!
how quality a woman is rowanne brewer lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud? thank you rowanne.
thank you @ltstevenlrogers. we will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!
i said that crooked hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement - bernie said the same thing!
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. isis china russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
look where the world is today a total mess and isis is still running around wild. i can fix it fast hillary has no chance!
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential? i don't think so! four more years of obama and our country will never come back. isis laughs!
crooked hillary can't even close the deal with bernie - and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary. four more years of this? no way!

crooked hillary clinton- discussing the #secondamendment at a private event. #2a cc: @nra
thanks @piersmorgan! trump is the most unpredictable extraordinary entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.
failing @nytimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. every article is unfair and biased. very sad!
thank you! an honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @nra- prior to @gopconvention! #trump2016 #2a
great day in kentucky with wayne lapierre chris cox & the @nra! #makeamericagreatagain #trump2016

@montgomeriefdn colin great to have you at trump turnberry. so proud of you and your great playing! you made winning majors look easy!
thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain.
crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. no gun owner can ever vote for clinton!
crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me. she is a very dishonest person!
while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day the tsa is falling apart just like our government! airports a total disaster!
crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. no more guns to protect hillary!
@rbacliff: hillary wants to rip the guns out of america's hands. no guns no protection. get on #trumptrain & join @nra to stop her.
.@cnn is so negative getting even worse as i get closer. just had two anti-trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. turning off!
make america great again!
crooked hillary clintons foreign interventions unleashed isis in syria iraq and libya. she is reckless and dangerous!
thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country. you are our true heroes! #armedforcesday
@dubilujane: i trust @realdonaldtrump more anyone ever to protect america.he will do the right thing for the u.s.a without a doubt.
crooked hillary said that i want guns brought into the school classroom. wrong!
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! would be four more years of stupidity!
why do the networks continue to put dopey @billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam which horribly oppresses women?
crooked hillary wants a radical 500 increase in syrian refugees. we cant allow this. time to get smart and protect america!
join me on wednesday may 25th at the anaheim convention center!#trump2016 #maga tickets:
bernie sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that crooked hillary clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
the american people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
thank you america! #trump2016
in trade military and everything else it will be america first! this will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: make america great again!
is hillary really protecting women?
obamas va secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times. hillary says va problems are not widespread. i will take care ofour vets!

while under no obligation to do so i have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars including 1million dollars from me for our veterans. nice!
much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
amazingly with all of the money i have raised for the vets i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
i just released my financial disclosure forms the largest numbers in the history of the f.e.c. even the dishonest media thinks great!
crooked hillary clinton overregulates overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. most importantly she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
a great new book has been written about crooked hillary. read it & you will never be able to vote for her. @ed klein
a wonderfully written article concerning israel by @jasondovesq
a suggestion for the dishonest media-
thank you @dailymail- for setting the failing @nytimes story straight. this is what the nyt's should have written!
after raising w no obligation almost $6m for vets i couldn't believe protesters formed @ trump tower. just out- sent by crooked hillary!
great honor to receive today's endorsement of @ricksantorum. really nice! #trump2016

@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren sometimes known as pocahontas bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. total hypocrite!
goofy senator elizabeth warren @elizabethforma has done less in the u.s. senate than practically any other senator. all talk no action!
crooked hillary clinton just can't close the deal with bernie. i had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. hillary doesn't have it
the protesters in new mexico were thugs who were flying the mexican flag. the rally inside was big and beautiful but outside criminals!
thank you washington! honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in gop primary history.
thank you anaheim california!#trump2016
the inspector general's report on crooked hillary clinton is a disaster. such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the w.h.

obama administration fails to screen syrian refugees' social media accounts:
great rally in fresno california- great crowd! thank you! #trump2016
the u.s. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. how nice but what do we get? not enough
i we broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! thank you.
the failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that i don't have many people. i have 73 hillary has 800- & i'm beating her.
the media is on a new phony kick about my management style. i spend much less money & get much better results! what we need as prez!
i am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when i won the gop nomination i'm in the back of the paper. very dishonest!
don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. the only quote that matters is a quote from me!
does president obama ever discuss the sneak attack on pearl harbor while he's in japan? thousands of american lives lost. #mdw
honor memorial day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! we love them.
heading to d.c. to see and hear rolling thunder. amazing people that love our country. great spirit!
good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b c i stand 100 behind everything we do.
bill kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the gop can't control their own then they are not a party. be tough r's!
the republican party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in november. can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler indie candidate!
if dummy bill kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent say good bye to the supreme court!
obama says a wall at our southern border won't enhance our security wrong and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall fence at w.h.
in getting the endorsement of the 16500 border patrol agents thank you the statement was made that the wall was very necessary!
the endorsement of me by the 16500 border patrol agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. nice!
@teapartynevada: #trump2016 illegals are taken care of better than our veterans.

@nbcdfw: trump rallies veterans at annual rolling thunder gathering
have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again!
i would have had millions of votes more in the primaries than crooked hillary if i only had one opponent instead of sixteen. broke record
i hope everyone had a great memorial day!
i have a judge in the trump university civil case gonzalo curiel san diego who is very unfair. an obama pick. totally biased-hates trump
i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge gonzalo curiel who is totally biased against me.
so many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! news conference at 11:00 a.m. today trump tower!
i have raised given a tremendous amount of money to our great veterans and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. watch!
just finished a press conference in trump tower wherein i gave information on which veterans groups got the $5600000 that i raised gave!
so many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money i raised gave! it was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
join me in sacramento california-tomorrow evening @ 7pm! #trump2016
i will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pme on @foxnews. enjoy!
katie couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
i am getting great credit for my press conference today. crooked hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. speaking of ratings- i will be on his show tonight @ 10pe.
so i raised gave $5600000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! they do anything to belittle - totally biased.

crooked hillary clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
bernie sanders was right when he said that crooked hillary clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from bad judgement!
do you ever notice that @cnn gives me very little proper representation on my policies. just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign p
wow usa today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. verdict: 450 wins 38 losses. isn't that what you want for your president?
join me in san jose california- tonight!#makeamericagreatagain #trump2016tickets:
with all of the crooked hillary clinton's foreign policy experience she has made so many mistakes - and i mean real monsters! no more hrc.
even though i have a very biased and unfair judge in the trump u civil case in san diego i have thousands of great reviews & will win case!
after the litigation is disposed of and the case won i have instructed my execs to open trump u ? so much interest in it! i will be pres.
crooked hillary clinton who i would love to call lyin' hillary is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
crooked hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. people will not allow another four years of incompetence!
bad performance by crooked hillary clinton! reading poorly from the telepromter! she doesn't even look presidential!
so great to have the endorsement and support of paul ryan. we will both be working very hard to make america great again!

i don't watch or do @morning joe anymore. small audience low ratings! i hear mika has gone wild with hate. joe is joe. they lost their way!
in crooked hillary's telepromter speech yesterday she made up things that i said or believe but have no basis in fact. not honest!
i'm a former chief of police in a border town. i'm hispanic i'm proud to be hispanic and i'm 100 behind trump.
so much interest in my visit to scotland! i greatly look forward to attending the opening event @trumpturnberry- taking place on june 24th.

many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful trump supporters in san jose were illegals. they burned the american flag and laughed at police

the clinton news network sometimes referred to as @cnn is getting more and more biased.they act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors
i am watching @cnn very little lately because they are so biased against me. shows are predictable garbage! cnn and msm is one big lie!
hillary clinton is unfit to be president. she has bad judgement poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. change!
people like @katyturnbc report on my campaign but have zero access. they say what they want without any knowledge.true of so much of media!
just like i have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1 so too should our country. we can be great!
crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
crooked hillary is being badly criticized for a wall street paid for ad by politifact for a false ad on me on women. she is a total fraud!
a massive blow to obama's message - only 38000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. that's really bad!
i am getting bad marks from certain pundits because i have a small campaign staff. but small is good flexible save money and number one!
remembering the fallen heroes on #dday - june 6 1944.
thank you diamond and silk!
see when i said nato was obsolete because of no terrorism protection they made the change without giving me credit.

really bad shooting in orlando. police investigating possible terrorism. many people dead and wounded.
clinton made a false ad about me where i was imitating a reporter groveling after he changed his story. i would never mock disabled. shame!
horrific incident in fl. praying for all the victims & their families. when will this stop? when will we get tough smart & vigilant?
appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism i don't want congrats i want toughness & vigilance. we must be smart!
is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism? if he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
reporting that orlando killer shouted allah hu akbar! as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in la with rifles near gay parade.
@wandawalls20: @realdonaldtrump please make us safe. we cannot have hillary as president. we will be in so much trouble.
what has happened in orlando is just the beginning. our leadership is weak and ineffective. i called it and asked for the ban. must be tough
i have been hitting obama and crooked hillary hard on not using the term radical islamic terror. hillary just broke-said she would now use!

terrorism immigration and national security speech- transcript:
i am no fan of president obama but to show you how dishonest the phony washington post is:
based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting trump campaign we are hereby:
in my speech on protecting america i spoke about a temporary ban which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to islamic terror.
i thought people werent celebrating? they were cheering all over even this savage from orlando. i was right.
saudi arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the clinton foundation- cont'd:

how can the ny times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? so totally dishonest!
yesterday's failing @nytimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech when in fact it was packed!
@bfraser747: watch out hillaryclinton support @realdonaldtrump #makeamericagreatagain
.@djohnsonpga we are so proud of you dustin. your reaction under pressure was amazing. first of many majors. you are a true champion!
when i said that if within the orlando club you had some people with guns i was obviously talking about additional guards or employees
crooked hillary clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament according to new book which is a mess!
i will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of crooked hillary clinton.
hillary says this election is about judgment. she's right. her judgement has killed thousands unleashed isis and wrecked the economy.
hillary clinton surged the trade deficit with china 40 assecretary of state costing americans millions of jobs.
how can hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
hillary clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all americans - and make everyone less safe.
obama-clinton inherited $10t in debt and turned it into nearly $20t. they have bankrupted
i am the king of debt. that has been great for me as a businessman but is bad for the country. i made a fortune off of debt will fix u.s.
hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
if you want to know about hillary clinton's honesty & judgment ask the family of ambassador stevens.
hillary defrauded america as secy of state. she used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! corrupt dangerous dishonest.
i will be interviewed by @loudobbs tonight on @foxbusiness 7pm et
crooked hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! she will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
@chrisboydbrew: @loudobbs @realdonaldtrump @foxbusiness.. saw your interview.you are the best! great questions great answers lou is great
hillary says things can't change. i say they have to change. it's a choice between americanism and her corrupt globalism. #imwithyou

hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. -- donald j. trump
isis threatens us today because of the decisions hillary clinton has made along with president obama. -- donald j. trump
hillary lies to benghazi families#crookedhillary
sc has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now. but hillary has pledged to expand it taking jobs from hispanic & african-american workers.
hillary clintons open borders are tearing american families apart. i am going to make our country safe again for all americans. #imwithyou
obama & clinton should stop meeting with special interests & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
on immigration im consulting with our immigration officers& our wage-earners. hillary clinton is consulting with wall street.
our inner cities have been left behind. we will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
cnn which is totally biased in favor of clinton should apologize. they knew they were wrong.
here is another cnn lie. the clinton news network is losing all credibility. im not watching it much anymore.
read my full statement here on the supreme court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou
meet the amazing mother whose letter i read during my speech. she lost her son to policies supported by clinton.

statement regarding british referendum on e.u. membership
getting ready to open the magnificent turnberry in scotland. what a great day especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.
self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the uk have exercised that right for all the world to see.
america is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w a free & ind uk. we stand together as friends as allies & as a people w a shared history.
new government data by the center for immigration studies shows more than 3m new legal & illegal immigrants settled..
i want all americans to succeed together. president obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...
crooked hillary called it totally wrong on brexit - she went with obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. she would be a disaster
the opening of trump turnberry in scotland was a big success. good timing i was here for brexit. very exciting news conference today!
many people are equating brexit and what is going on in great britain with what is happening in the u.s. people want their country back!
@darrenwaggener: @realdonaldtrump what has happened in the uk in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in november..vote trump 2016
@jolena3: @realdonaldtrump and we will get it back once we have president trump! can't wait!

we must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
we only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #americafirst
i have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
obama has blocked ice officers and bp from doing their jobs. that ends when i am president!
just landed in new york - a one night stay in scotland. turnberry came out magnificently. my son eric did a great job - under budget!
george will one of the most overrated political pundits who lost his way long ago has left the republican party.he's made many bad calls
crooked hillary clinton who called brexit 100 wrong along with obama is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call.
clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads. disgraceful!
crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry. shows me hitting shot but i never did lie! was there to support son
the @abc poll sample is heavy on democrats. very dishonest - why would they do that? other polls good!
top 50 facts about crooked hillary clinton from trump 'stakes of the election' address:
people in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win. it is time for change -- and jobs!
hillary clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! she is spending a fortune i am spending very little. close in polls!
crooked hillary clinton got brexit wrong. i said leave will win. she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. only a question of time
crooked hillary attacks foreign government donations - while ignoring her own:
the dirty poll done by @abc @washingtonpost is a disgrace. even they admit that many more democrats were polled. other polls were good.
@jimvitari: @abc @washingtonpost we know they're fake just like poles during primary. i'm sure u will crush #crookedhillary in general
@brazosboys: hillary read sigh off the teleprompter she's so fake she has to be told how to feel: @foxnews
@w4djt: under a trump presidency america will make brilliant new trade deals! donald trump #dtmag
@lindasuhler: trump voters don't scare or back down. our numbers are growing & we're taking our country back. #trump2016 #maga
crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u.s. senate goofy elizabeth warren who lied on heritage.
the media is unrelenting. they will only go with and report a story in a negative light. i called brexit hillary was wrong watch november
.@cnn is all negative when it comes to me. i don't watch it anymore.

check it out - 2nd video on lying crooked hillary is now online! watch it here: #crookedhillary #trump2016
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure. it justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton.
hillary clintons presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country. she is ill-fit with bad judgment.
yet another terrorist attack this time in turkey. willthe world ever realize what is going on? so sad.
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states.
@jtsbk: @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was. the media makes everything up!
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker. china and many others are taking advantage of u.s. with our terrible trade pacts
why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters?
just watched senator john barrasso on @foxnews - he was great! thank you john.

@gengm7: @jakeda @realdonaldtrump as of april this year hillary had spent $264000000 on her campaign mr.trump $55000000. self funding
tremendous day in massachusetts and maine. thank you to everyone for making it so special!
for reasons only they can explain the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
the story with hillary will never change.
new book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #wakeupamerica
why would college graduates want crooked hillary as their president? she will destroy them!
one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out america.
the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal!
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan!
the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple i want to make america great again!
i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox! enjoy!
#throwbackthursday #trump2016
as bernie sanders said hillary clinton has bad judgement. bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary!
bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
take a look at what happened w bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
.@traceadkins great job on fox this morning. keep up the good work!
horrible killing of a 13 year old american girl at her home in israel by a palestinian terrorist. we must get tough.
yet another terrorist attack today in israel -- a father shot at by a palestinian terrorist was killed while:
these crimes won't be happening if i'm elected potus. killer should have never been here. #americafirst

just read in the failing @nytimes that i was not aware the event had to be held in cleveland - a total lie. these people are sick!

it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong! what bill did was stupid!
it was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said the system is totally rigged!
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd and the entire show is against me.the good news-the people get it!
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know.
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged & corrupt!
on saturday a great man elie wiesel passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
the system is rigged!
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away no pictures.
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught!
in bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed!
the third mass attack slaughter in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this!
crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis - it will just go on forever. we need change!
happy 4th of july! #trump2016 #americafirst
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star or plain star!
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally one-sided interview by chuck todd the end result was solid!
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed great people!
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa!
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked!
crooked hillary clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! where are the 33000 missing e-mails?
with hillary and obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools won't even call it what it is - radical islam!
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays?
on @foxnews at 7:00 p.m. special: meet the trumps hope you enjoy!
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace!
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again!
the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair! as usual bad judgment.
fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security. no charges. wow! #riggedsystem
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while. we will be traveling to north carolina together today.
my son @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews. enjoy!
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm. enjoy!
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support! win
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with murder. come november 8 she's out!
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement!
crooked hillary clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information. not fit!
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement.
the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges but...
crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country. she is sooooo guilty. but watch her time will come!
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago great timing as all know . pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves - convention center airport - and destroyed city
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a.c. others to follow. ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city.
sleepy eyes chuck todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again.he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n.c.
i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton. check it out sleepy eyes @markhalperin @nbcpolitics
convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. let today be devoted to crooked hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
to all of my twitter followers please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. we must beat crooked hillary.

after today crooked hillary can officially be called lyin' crooked hillary.
prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 dallas law enforcement officers...
due to the horrific events taking place in our country i have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in miami.
isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy hillary clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @cnn?
make america safe again!
way to go @serenawilliams - you are a true champion. proud of you!
new poll - thank you! #trump2016
look what is happening to our country under the weak leadership of obama and people like crooked hillary clinton. we are a divided nation!
president obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. he is living in a world of the make believe!
the media is so dishonest. if i make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.they think the public is stupid!
i heard that the underachieving john king of @cnn on inside politics was one hour of lies. happily few people are watching - dead network!
join me in westfield indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm! #trump2016 tickets:

this election is a choice between law order & safety - or chaos crime & violence. i will make america safe again for everyone. #imwithyou
bernie sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. he will endorse her today - fans angry!
i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. they are not happy that he is selling out!
#crookedhillary is not qualified!
bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs.
bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-tpp pro-wall street crooked hillary clinton.
to all the bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. people first.
the american people agree. no free pass for #crookedhillary!

#crookedhillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in florida ohio & pennsylvania. i haven't started yet!
new gop platform now includes language that supports the border wall. we will build the wall and make america safe again!
the republican platform is most pro-israel of all time!
is president obama trying to destroy israel with all his bad moves? think about it and let me know!
lyin' crooked hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.
despite spending $500k a day on tv ads alone #crookedhillary falls flat in nationwide @quinnipiacpoll. having zero impact. sad!!
voters understand that crooked hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
on my way to san diego to raise money for the republican party. i am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
is supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? big mistake by an incompetent judge!
even the @nytimes and @washingtonpost editorial boards condemned justice ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. what was she thinking?
if i win the presidency we will swamp justice ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
i will be making the announcement of my vice presidential pick on friday at 11am in manhattan. details to follow.

i employ many people in the state of virginia - jobs jobs jobs! crooked hillary will sell us out just like her husband did with nafta.
another horrific attack this time in nice france. many dead and injured. when will we learn? it is only getting worse.
in light of the horrible attack in nice france i have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement.
my prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in nice france. we are with you in every way!
#nevertrump is never more. they were crushed last night in cleveland at rules committee by a vote of 87-12. make america great again!
four more years of weakness with a crooked hillary administration is not acceptable. look what has happened to the world with o & hillary!
i am pleased to announce that i have chosen governor mike pence as my vice presidential running mate. news conference tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.
look forward to governor mike pence v.p. introduction tomorrow in new york city.
look forward to introducing governor mike pence who has done a spectacular job in the great state of indiana . my first choice from start!
crooked hillary is spending big wall street money on ads saying i don't have foreign policy experience yet look what her policies have done
crooked hillary who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies has been a disaster on foreign policy. look what's happening!
very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes crooked hillary clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
crooked hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street lobbyists and special interests. she will sell our country down the tubes!
thank you! #trumppence16

goofy elizabeth warren who may be the least productive senator in the u.s. senate must prove she is not a fraud. without the con it's over
we are going to have a great time in cleveland. will lead to special results for our country. we will make america great again!
as the days and weeks go by we see what a total mess our country and world is in - crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions!
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. bernie said she has bad judgement!
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her v.p. then we can litigate her fraud!
if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didn't lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today. pick her h
.@foxnews is much better and far more truthful than @cnn which is all negative. guests are stacked for crooked hillary! i don't watch.
the ratings at @foxnews blow away the ratings of @cnn - not even close. that's because cnn is the clinton news network and people don't like
we grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today. how many law enforcement and people have to...
we are trying to fight isis and now our own people are killing our police. our country is divided and out of control. the world is watching

congratulations to my children don and tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night. i am very proud of you!
bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. more than in past years.
in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state. jobs!
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails.

what a great four days in cleveland. so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all. the police and secret service were fantastic!
thank you cleveland. we love you and will be back many times!
one of the best produced including the incredible stage & set in the history of conventions. great unity! big t.v. ratings! @karlrove
another attack this time in germany. many killed. god bless the people of munich.
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did?
i highly recommend the just out book - the field of fight - by general michael flynn. how to defeat radical islam.
@theresa cali: @realdonaldtrump general michael flynn will make a great secretary of defense when you become potus! #makeamericasafeagain
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight?
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing!
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also crooked hillary hates her!
leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on-line from wikileakes really vicious. rigged
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta.
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back!
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer!
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs!
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me!
the wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!
thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart!
@olimauritania: @realdonaldtrump kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals #hillarykaine2016
@nancynielsenn: @realdonaldtrump dinesh d'sousa hillary's america. see it
#makeamericagreatagain#trumppence16
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h!
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for v.p. is ending really weak. so much for a movement! total disrespect
wow president obama's brother malik just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite!
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates.
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution. he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect. sad!
today proves what i have always known that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz @dwstweets.
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left!
the @cnn panels are so one sided almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn!
if the republican convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. bernie media would go wild
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws. too bad bernie flamed out
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook!
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! e-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory she's out!
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. thank you!
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis & all others laughing!
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against bernie!
hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
thank you! #makeamericagreatagain
if bernie sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc - they just got caught that's all! they laughed at bernie.
here we go again with another clinton scandal and e-mails yet can you believe . crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance!
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change!
great poll numbers are coming out all over. people don't want another four years of obama and crooked hillary would be even worse. #maga

clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war.
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time energy and money. the v.p. a joke!
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing. he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air!
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself.
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated!
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! waste of time.
funny if you listen to @foxnews the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two they are fawning. what a difference
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. the republican convention was great
pocahontas bombed last night! sad to watch.

the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
bernie's exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
dems don't want to talk isis b c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump. crazy!
for the record i have zero investments in russia.
im with you! i will work hard and never let you down. make america great again!
i'm with you! i will work hard and never let you down. make america great again!
i'm with you! i will work hard and never let you down. make america great again!
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing . please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. highly overrated!
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention!
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep?
just like i have warned from the beginning crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp.
as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius. america 1st!
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition - sad!
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough!
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no!
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy. sorry joe that was ted cruz!
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining-then a small one. pathetic
join our next vice president @mike pence in wisconsin tonight & michigan thursday!mi:
if russia or any other country or person has hillary clinton's 33000 illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the fbi!

@davidwohl: barack is offended that @realdonaldtrump will demand that #nato allies pay their fair share. #demsinphilly
@trumplican2016: @realdonaldtrump @davidwohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the people
president obama spoke last night about a world that doesnt exist. 70 of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #dnc
@lallyray: poll: donald trump sees 17-point positive swing in two weeks - breitbart @realdonaldtrump great!
bernie caved!
america's future
a vote for clinton-kaine is a vote for tpp nafta high taxes radical regulation and massive influx of refugees.
median household income is down for the middle class since obama took office. it will only go further down under clinton.
great to be back in iowa! #tbt with @jerryjrfalwell joining me in davenport- this past winter. #maga

departing now - thank you cedar rapids iowa. this is a movement!
i will once again write a $1 million check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a 550 increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street!
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety.
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction terrorism and isis across the world.
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke. @cnn and the little watched @morning joe sad!
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream!
two policemen just shot in san diego one dead. it is only getting worse. people want law and order!
campaign statement:
@anncoulter: i believe in science dem code for we're shutting down coal mines steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing
join @mike pence at the university of northwestern ohio- tonight at 7pm. tickets:
crooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
general john allen who i never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against isis. his record bad #neverhillary
little michael bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me. his last term as mayor was a disaster!
if michael bloomberg ran again for mayor of new york he wouldn't get 10 of the vote - they would run him out of town! #neverhillary
crooked hillary said that i couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. reallyi just beat 16 people and am beating her!
thank you! facebook:
the dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech. he wishes he didn't make that deal!
in hillary clinton's america - things get worse. #trumppence16
wow my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary. she sold them out v.p. pick!
i am watching crooked hillary speak. same old stuff our country needs change!
what bernie sanders really thinks of crooked hillary clinton.
join me in colorado springs at 2pm- or in denver tonight at 7pm!colorado springs:

thank you colorado springs. get out & vote #trumppence16 in november!
thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in colorado!#makeamericagreatagain #lesm
hillary clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
#crookedhillary job application
as usual hillary & the dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major nfl games. same as last time w bernie. unacceptable!
thank you denver colorado! #makeamericagreatagain!
@patrioticpepe: @realdonaldtrump only trump can unite america and fix obama's mistakes!!! #trump2016
colorado was amazing yesterday! so much support. our tax trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to colorado and the whole country.
hillary can never win over bernie supporters. her foreign wars nafta tpp support & wall street ties are driving away millions of votes.
we are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. i want change - crooked hillary clinton does not.
american homeownership rate in q2 2016 was 62.9 - lowest rate in 51yrs. we will bring back the 'american dream!'

just got back from colorado. the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. big crowds!
i will write a $2 million check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
violent crime is rising across the united states yet the dnc convention ignored it. crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes. a formula for disaster!
#crookedhillary
why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches - republican's won ratings
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch. much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!
word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania. perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta?
#crookedhillary obama's third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.
crooked's stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 - with bill vp
the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico. end!
wow nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills. this is a general i will like!
nato commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:
can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania. it would be a major media event! @cnn @foxnews
thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the republican national convention #1 over crooked hillary and dems.
nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech: trump 32.2 million. clinton 27.8 million. thank you!
we crushed the original goal! i will write a $2 million check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!
captain khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it!
i was viciously attacked by mr. khan at the democratic convention. am i not allowed to respond? hillary voted for the iraq war not me!
the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention. i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h?
@realjameswoods: without absolutely owning the liberal media hillaryclinton wouldn't stand a chance. #voterfraud and #msm her only hope.
wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. the failing @nytimes is a joke. @cnn is laughable!
mr. khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over t.v. doing the same - nice!
this story is not about mr. khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the u.s. get smart!
when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine you can mark it down i am saying if i am president. already in crimea!
so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine they have already taken crimea and continue to push. that's what i said!
#crookedhillary
join governor mike pence in reno nevada- tonight at 7pm! tickets available at:
cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton.
cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillary's pay-for-play at state department?
will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt hillary?
the people who support hillary sit behind cnn anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
people believe cnn these days almost as little as they believe hillary....that's really saying something!

crooked hillary clinton is 100 owned by her donors. #imwithyou #maga
hillary whose decisions have led to the deaths of many accepted $ from a business linked to isis. silence at cnn.
hillary clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against radical islam.
when will cnn do a segment on hillarys plan to increase syrian refugees 550 and how much it will cost?
during the gop convention cnn cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. they dont want them heard.

president obama should ask the dnc about how they rigged the election against bernie.
obama's disastrous judgment gave us isis rise of iran and the worst economic numbers since the great depression!
president obama refuses to answer question about iran terror funding. i won't dodge questions as your president.
the plane i saw on television was the hostage plane in geneva switzerland not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to iran!
hillary clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as president.

crooked hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she short circuited when answering a question on her e-mails. very dangerous!

.@dbongino you were fantastic in defending both the second amendment and me last night on @cnn. don lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock

@laurencristmann: thank you for coming to pennsylvania today. i will be there with @c lynne ryan your 3rd cd delegate at 2 pm
a massive tax increase will be necessary to fund crooked hillary clinton's agenda. what a terrible and boring rollout that was yesterday!

@zulu out: you are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #makeamericagreatagain #usa loves u thanks
the failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. their reporting is fiction. the media protects hillary!
the failing @nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change. false i am who i am-never said
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say i would be beating hillary by 20
my rallies are not covered properly by the media. they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media. she is not a talented person or politician. the dishonest media refuses to expose!
i am not only fighting crooked hillary i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. people get it!
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
i have always been the same person-remain true to self.the media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
stay on message is the chant. i always do - trade jobs military vets 2nd a repeal ocare borders etc - but media misrepresents!
certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the u.s.supreme court get proper appointments. sad!

hillary clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. she should be ashamed of herself!
hillary clinton is using race-baiting to try to get african-american voters- but they know she is all talk and no action!
hrc is using the oldest play in the dem playbook- when their policies fail they are left w this one tired argument!
hillary clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. no policy and always very short stamina . media gives her a pass!

@rhondar: thank-you clarence henderson for telling @cnn you know racism & it's not donaldtrump via @breitbartnews
@pmnorlando: @realdonaldtrump i know of no one voting for crooked hillary! her rallies are held in blank & she still has room.
does anyone know that crooked hillary who tried so hard was unable to pass the bar exams in washington d.c. she was forced to go elsewhere
crooked hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.probably why her decision making is so bad or as stated by bernie s she has bad judgement
now that african-americans are seeing what a bad job hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities they want trump!

great visit to detroit church fantastic reception and all @cnn talks about is a small protest outside. inside a large and wonderful crowd!
.@cnn is so disgusting in their bias but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
wow the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release. they are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
crooked hillary's v.p. pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea. a total lie - and taken over during o term!
@annebellar: @realdonaldtrump @cnn cnn is so biased. never ever watch them. trump 2016!!
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders not weak people such as @jeffflake if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
the great state of arizona where i just had a massive rally amazing people has a very weak and ineffective senator jeff flake. sad!
the polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
to the african-american community: the democrats have failed you for fifty years high crime poor schools no jobs. i will fix it vote t
lyin' hillary clinton told the fbi that she did not know the c markings on documents stood for classified. how can this be happening?
@chernuna: @realdonaldtrump it defies belief the web of lies hillary is spinning! one excuse after another. then it's this then it's that.
@lblackvelvet: @realdonaldtrump we need to show americans that hillary will kill our country !! vote for trump !!
@ronnieclemmons: @chriscjackson @takouis @realdonaldtrump trump now leads her by 2 - get real she will lose big

wow reviews are in - thank you!
a rough night for hillary clinton abc news.
hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. she's being decimated by the media!
hillary clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. she is totally confused. unfit to serve as #potus.
mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who i know is highly respected by president pea nieto.
with luis mexico and the united states would have made wonderful deals together - where both mexico and the us would have benefitted.
last nights results - in poll taken by nbc. #americafirst #imwithyou
more poll results from last nights commander-in-chief forum. #americafirst #trumptrain
it wasn't matt lauer that hurt hillary last night. it was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
final poll results from nbc on last nights commander-in-chief forum. thank you! #imwithyou #maga
the documentary of me that @cnn just aired is a total waste of time. i don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. a joke!
.@cnn is unwatchable. their news on me is fiction. theyare a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the clinton campaign.
jeff zucker failed @nbc and he is now failing @cnn.
henry mcmaster lt. governor of south carolina who endorsed me beat failed @cnn announcer bakari sellers so badly. funny!

will be in missouri today with melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman phyllis s!
wow hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters millions of amazing hard working people. i think it will cost her at the polls!
really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad. lindsey graham romney flake sass. supreme court remember!
while hillary said horrible things about my supporters and while many of her supporters will never vote for me i still respect them all!
hillary clinton just had her 47 moment. what a terrible thing she said about so many great americans!
the seriously failing @nytimes despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place only writes dishonest hits!

just arrived in texas - have been informed two @fortworthpd officers have been shot. my thoughts and prayers are with them.
a very interesting take from @katiepavlich:
donald trumps birther event is the greatest trick hes ever pulled
my thoughts and prayers go out to the @phillypolice & @penn police officers- in philadelphia.
crooked hillary wants to take your 2nd amendment rights away. will guns be taken from her heavily armed secret service detail? maybe not!
i never met former defense secretary robert gates. he knows nothing about me. but look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
.@cnn just doesn't get it and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. boring anti-trump panelists mostly losers in life!
wacky @nytimesdowd who hardly knows me makes up things that i never said for her boring interviews and column. a neurotic dope!
crazy maureen dowd the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes pretends she knows me well--wrong!
the failing @nytimes has gone nuts that crooked hillary is doing so badly. they are willing to say anything has become a laughingstock rag!
my lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. i said no for now but they are watching. really disgusting
heading to colorado for a big rally. massive crowd great people! will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
never met but never liked dopey robert gates. look at the mess the u.s. is in. always speaks badly of his many bosses including obama.
i would like to express my warmest regards best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in nyc.
happy birthday - to the united states air force!!
under the leadership of obama & clinton americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. time to change the playbook!
terrible attacks in ny nj and mn this weekend. thinking of victims their families and all americans! we need to be strong!

wow did you see how badly @cnn clinton news network is doing in the ratings. with people like @donlemon who could expect any more?
anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying sources said do not believe it. there are no sources they are just made up lies!
wow crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u. hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past which is terrible!
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement! hillary was set up by a con.
did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a u.s. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
remember don't believe sources said by the very dishonest media. if they don't name the sources the sources don't exist.
the people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the dallas & arizona papers & now usa today will lose readers! the people get it!

wow the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the trump phenomena
the @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their bad coverage of me. i wonder if it will change - doubt it?

jeb bush george w and george h.w. all called to express their best wishes on the win. very nice!

if the election were based on total popular vote i would have campaigned in n.y. florida and california and won even bigger and more easily
the electoral college is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play. campaigning is much different!
very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions. i am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
i am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children. this was a typically false news story.
the failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. it is going so smoothly. also i have spoken to many foreign leaders.

australia new zealand and more. i am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.

i cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. not nice
perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. in the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
the failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. i can fully understand that - but why announce?
great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.

i am working hard even on thanksgiving trying to get carrier a.c. company to stay in the u.s. indiana . making progress - will know soon!
fidel castro is dead!
the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized dems
the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. not so anymore!
hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. nothing will change
hillary's debate answer on delay: that is horrifying. that is not the way our democracy works. been around for 240 years. we've had free --
and fair elections. we've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -
during a general election. i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --
of position. then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --
this election. that is a direct threat to our democracy. she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald --
trump is going to be our president. we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. so much time and money will be spent - same result! sad
in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
it would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4--
states instead of the 15 states that i visited. i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten !
serious voter fraud in virginia new hampshire and california - so why isn't the media reporting on this? serious bias - big problem!
if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people the cuban american people and the u.s. as a whole i will terminate deal.
just met with general petraeus--was very impressed!
@highonhillcrest: @jeffzeleny what proof do u have donaldtrump did not suffer from millions of fraud votes? journalist? do your job! @cnn
@joebowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic cnn part time wannabe journalist ! @cnn still doesn't get it. they will never learn!
@fiiibuster: @jeffzeleny pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that donald trump did not suffer from voter fraud shame! bad reporter.
@sdcritic: @highonhillcrest @jeffzeleny @cnn there is no question that #voterfraud did take place and in favor of #corrupthillary !

bill clinton stated that i called him after the election. wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations . he doesn't know much ...
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states and more . they focused on wrong states
yes it is true - carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting. we met he is a great guy!
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. hillary focused on the wrong states!
i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss!
i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today talking about airplane capability and pricing. very impressive people!

i will be interviewed by @thebrodyfile on @cbnnews tonight at 11pm. enjoy!
somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the fake news and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!
our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting now. look what is happening all over europe and indeed the world - a horrible mess!
christians in the middle-east have been executed in large numbers. we cannot allow this horror to continue!
the joint statement of former presidential candidates john mccain & lindsey graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration. the two...
...senators should focus their energies on isis illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start world war iii.
statement regarding recent executive order concerning extreme vetting:
i will be interviewed by @thebrodyfile on @cbnnews tonight at 11pm. enjoy!
only 109 people out of 325000 were detained and held for questioning. big problems at airports were caused by delta computer outage.....

there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. this was a big part of my campaign. study the world!

getting ready to deliver a very important decision! 8:00 p.m.
join me live from the @whitehouse.
hope you like my nomination of judge neil gorsuch for the united states supreme court. he is a good and brilliant man respected by all.
everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban. call it what you want it is about keeping bad people with bad intentions out of country!
iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u.s. has squandered three trillion dollars there. obvious long ago!
do you believe it? the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia. why? i will study this dumb deal!
if u.c. berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - no federal funds?
congratulations to rex tillerson on being sworn in as our new secretary of state. he will be a star!
attending chief ryan owens' dignified transfer yesterday with my daughter ivanka was my great honor. to a great and brave man - thank you!
iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.should have been thankful for the terrible deal the u.s. made with them!
iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the u.s. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the iran deal: $150 billion
thank you @samsung! we would love to have you!
yes arnold schwarzenegger did a really bad job as governor of california and even worse on the apprentice...but at least he tried hard!
iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how kind president obama was to them. not me!
thank you to prime minister of australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that fake news media lied about. very nice!
meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. good jobs are coming back to u.s. health care and tax bills are being crafted now!
professional anarchists thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to make america great again!
a new radical islamic terrorist has just attacked in louvre museum in paris. tourists were locked down. france on edge again. get smart u.s.
we must keep evil out of our country!
countries charge u.s. companies taxes or tariffs while the u.s. charges them nothing or little.we should charge them same as they charge us!
when a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in & out especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban. they know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
the opinion of this so-called judge which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned!
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the fake news @nytimes is still lost!
make america great again!
what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into u.s.?
because the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. a terrible decision
why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
interview with @oreillyfactor on fox network - 4:00 p.m. prior to super bowl . enjoy!
the judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. bad people are very happy!
just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. if something happens blame him and court system. people pouring in. bad!
i have instructed homeland security to check people coming into our country very carefully. the courts are making the job very difficult!
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor at 4:00 p.m. prior to the #superbowl pre-game show on fox network. enjoy!
enjoy the #superbowl and then we continue: make america great again!
what an amazing comeback and win by the patriots. tom brady bob kraft and coach b are total winners. wow!
any negative polls are fake news just like the cnn abc nbc polls in the election. sorry people want border security and extreme vetting.
i call my own shots largely based on an accumulation of data and everyone knows it. some fake news media in order to marginalize lies!
will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 p.m.
the failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. they have gotten it wrong for two years and now are making up stories & sources!
an extended interview from the super bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 p.m. enjoy!
the failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win. now they are worse!

sen.richard blumenthal who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had major lie now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him?
chris cuomo in his interview with sen. blumenthal never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave service in vietnam. fake news!
sen. mccain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. only emboldens the enemy! he's been losing so....

jeff sessions is an honest man. he did not say anything wrong. he could have stated his response more accurately but it was clearly not....
...intentional. this whole narrative is a way of saving face for democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....
...to win. the democrats are overplaying their hand. they lost the election and now they have lost their grip on reality. the real story...
...is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. it is a total witch hunt!

the first meeting jeff sessions had with the russian amb was set up by the obama administration under education program for 100 ambs......
terrible! just found out that obama had my wires tapped in trump tower just before the victory. nothing found. this is mccarthyism!
just out: the same russian ambassador that met jeff sessions visited the obama white house 22 times and 4 times last year alone.
is it legal for a sitting president to be wire tapping a race for president prior to an election? turned down by court earlier. a new low!
i'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october just prior to election!
how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. this is nixon watergate. bad or sick guy!
arnold schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the apprentice he was fired by his bad pathetic ratings not by me. sad end to great show

it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the #fakenews media.
whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media and they don't mention names....

so now it is reported that the democrats who have excoriated carter page about russia don't want him to testify. he blows away their....
...case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing the false or misleading testimony by james comey john brennan... witch hunt!

we need to be smart vigilant and tough. we need the courts to give us back our rights. we need the travel ban as an extra level of safety!
whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u. k. we will be there - we are with you. god bless!
we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. if we don't get smart it will only get worse
at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is no reason to be alarmed!
do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? that's because they used knives and a truck!
people the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but i am calling it what we need and what it is a travel ban!
the justice dept. should have stayed with the original travel ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to s.c.
the justice dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court - & seek much tougher version!
in any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the u.s. in order to help keep our country safe. the courts are slow and political!
.@foxandfriends dems are taking forever to approve my people including ambassadors. they are nothing but obstructionists! want approvals.
pathetic excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement. msm is working hard to sell it!
.@secshulkin's decision is one of the biggest wins for our veterans in decades. our heroes deserve the best!
today i announced an air traffic control initiative to take american air travel into the future - finally!
that's right we need a travel ban for certain dangerous countries not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
big meeting today with republican leadership concerning tax cuts and healthcare. we are all pushing hard - must get it right!
the fake msm is working so hard trying to get me not to use social media. they hate that i can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
during my recent trip to the middle east i stated that there can no longer be funding of radical ideology. leaders pointed to qatar - look!
sorry folks but if i would have relied on the fake news of cnn nbc abc cbs washpost or nytimes i would have had zero chance winning wh
so good to see the saudi arabia visit with the king and 50 countries already paying off. they said they would take a hard line on funding...

former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between trump & russia.
by the way if russia was working so hard on the 2016 election it all took place during the obama admin. why didn't they stop them?
...why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks long prior to election . it's all a big dem hoax!
...why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi and still hasn't? it's all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out. that would be very bad for the republican party - and please let cryin' chuck stay!
with all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts unmasking and illegal leaking of information i have no idea...

weekly address
just out: the obama administration knew far in advance of november 8th about election meddling by russia. did nothing about it. why?
democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100 . remember keep your doctor keep your plan?
since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling why no action? focus on them not t!
obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election. they didn't want to hurt hillary?
i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer!
make america great again!
hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders. is she allowed to so collude? unfair to bernie!
i am on @foxandfriends - enjoy!
the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas. all they do is delay and complain.they own obamacare!
the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win..
...and did not want to rock the boat. he didn't choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good.
the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling. with 4 months looking at russia...
..under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding. there is no collusion & no obstruction. i should be given apology!
republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats. not easy! perhaps just let ocare crash & burn!
very grateful for the 9-o decision from the u. s. supreme court. we must keep america safe!
from @foxnews bombshell: in 2016 obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election. check out his statement - witch hunt!
great day for america's future security and safety courtesy of the u.s. supreme court. i will keep fighting for the american people & win!
wow cnn had to retract big story on russia with 3 employees forced to resign. what about all the other phony stories they do? fake news!
fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories. ratings way down!
so they caught fake news cnn cold but what about nbc cbs & abc? what about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? they are all fake news!
with zero democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous obamacare as the dems legacy the republican senators are working hard!
i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare. they really want to get it right unlike ocare!
the failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. they don't even call to verify the facts of a story. a fake news joke!
some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare. wrong i know the subject well & want victory for u.s.
the #amazonwashingtonpost sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes which they should is fake news!

...and safe. questions were asked about why the cia & fbi had to ask the dnc 13 times for their server and were rejected still don't....
...have it. fake news said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 had to apologize . why did obama do nothing when he had info before election?

republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now & work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate. dems will join in!
we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans. most republicans were loyal terrific & worked really hard. we will return!
as i have always said let obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. stay tuned!
with only a very small majority the republicans in the house & senate need more victories next year since dems totally obstruct no votes!
the senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. even parts of full repeal need 60. 8 dems control senate. crazy!

as the phony russian witch hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold democrats and russians!
it's very sad that republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their president.
it's hard to read the failing new york times or the amazon washington post because every story opinion even if should be positive is bad!
if republicans don't repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
thank you to @loudobbs for giving the first six months of the trump administration an a . s.c.reg cuttingstock m jobsborder etc. true!
drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the fake news!

if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority not senseless 60...

republican senate must get rid of 60 vote now! it is killing the r party allows 8 dems to control country. 200 bills sit in senate. a joke!
the very outdated filibuster rule must go. budget reconciliation is killing r's in senate. mitch m go to 51 votes now and win. it's time!
republicans in the senate will never win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority now. they look like fools and are just wasting time......
....8 dems totally control the u.s. senate. many great republican bills will never pass like kate's law and complete healthcare. get smart!
if the senate democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. they are laughing at r's. make change!

the fake news media will not talk about the importance of the united nations security council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on n. korea!

republicans sorry but i've been hearing about repeal & replace for 7 years didn't happen! even worse the senate filibuster rule will....
...never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 dems control - will rarely get 60 vs. 51 votes. it is a repub death wish!
republicans must start the tax reform tax cut legislation asap. don't wait until the end of september. needed now more than ever. hurry!
a message to my fellow americans#irmahurricane2017
churches in texas should be entitled to reimbursement from fema relief funds for helping victims of hurricane harvey just like others .

no deal was made last night on daca. massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. would be subject to vote.
the wall which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built.

another attack in london by a loser terrorist.these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard. must be proactive!
loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.the internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
the travel ban into the united states should be far larger tougher and more specific-but stupidly that would not be politically correct!

alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like big luther strange. smart tough on crime borders & trade loves vets & military. tuesday!
i would not sign graham-cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. it does! a great bill. repeal & replace.
the nra strongly endorses luther strange for senator of alabama.that means all gun owners should vote for big luther. he won't let you down!
senator doctor bill cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their health care he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!
governor @ricardorossello- we are with you and the people of puerto rico. stay safe! #prstrong

senator luther strange has gone up a lot in the polls since i endorsed him a month ago. now a close runoff. he will be great in d.c.
a big day for the u.s. at the united nations!
rand paul or whoever votes against hcare bill will forever future political campaigns be known as the republican who saved obamacare.
kim jong un of north korea who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before!
thank you!
the russia hoax continues now it's ads on facebook. what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary?
the greatest influence over our election was the fake news media screaming for crooked hillary clinton. next she was a bad candidate!
will be in alabama tonight. luther strange has gained mightily since my endorsement but will be very close. he loves alabama and so do i!
#usaatunga#unga
thank you to doug parker and american airlines for all of the help you have given to the u.s. with hurricane flights. fantastic job!
heading to alabama now big crowd!
john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill which his governor loves. he campaigned on repeal & replace. let arizona down!
arizona had a 116 increase in obamacare premiums last year with deductibles very high. chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods. sad
large block grants to states is a good thing to do. better control & management. great for arizona. mccain let his best friend l.g. down!
i know rand paul and i think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party!
alaska had a 200 plus increase in premiums under obamacare worst in the country. deductibles high people angry! lisa m comes through.
it was great being with luther strange last night in alabama. what great people what a crowd! vote luther on tuesday.
going to the white house is considered a great honor for a championship team.stephen curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nflor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
...our great american flag or country and should stand for the national anthem. if not you're fired. find something else to do!
very proud of our incredible first lady @flotus. she is a truly great representative for our country!
iran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching israel.they are also working with north korea.not much of an agreement we have!
democrats are laughingly saying that mccain had a moment of courage. tell that to the people of arizona who were deceived. 116 increase!
roger goodell of nfl just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.tell them to stand!
just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u.n. if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man they won't be around much longer!
if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag & country you will see change take place fast. fire or suspend!
...nfl attendance and ratings are way down. boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. league should back u.s.
great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country. standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. bad ratings!
please to inform that the champion pittsburgh penguins of the nhl will be joining me at the white house for ceremony. great team!
courageous patriots have fought and died for our great american flag --- we must honor and respect it! make america great again!
alaska arizona maine and kentucky are big winners in the healthcare proposal. 7 years of repeal & replace and some senators not there.
sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country. nfl should change policy!
making america safe is my number one priority. we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
so proud of nascar and its supporters and fans. they won't put up with disrespecting our country or our flag - they said it loud and clear!
many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday which was a small percentage of total . these are fans who demand respect for our flag!
the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. it is about respect for our country flag and national anthem. nfl must respect this!
the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. important meetings taking place today. big tax cuts & reform.
#standforouranthem
.@cnn is #fakenews. just reported cos john kelly was opposed to my stance on nfl players disrespecting flag anthem country. total lie!

tremendous backlash against the nfl and its players for disrespect of our country.#standforouranthem
texas & florida are doing great but puerto rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt is in deep trouble..
...it's old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated. much of the island was destroyed with billions of dollars....

big election tomorrow in the great state of alabama. vote for senator luther strange tough on crime & border - will never let you down!
ratings for nfl football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
the booing at the nfl football game last night when the entire dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest i have ever heard. great anger

thank you to carmen yulin cruz the mayor of san juan for your kind words on fema etc.we are working hard. much food and water there on way
the nfl has all sorts of rules and regulations. the only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our national anthem!
alabama get out and vote for luther strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #maga

the mayor of san juan who was very complimentary only a few days ago has now been told by the democrats that you must be nasty to trump.
...such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan and others in puerto rico who are not able to get their workers to help. they....
...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job.
the military and first responders despite no electric roads phones etc. have done an amazing job. puerto rico was totally destroyed.
fake news cnn and nbc are going out of their way to disparage our great first responders as a way to get trump. not fair to fr or effort!
i will be going to puerto rico on tuesday with melania. will hopefully be able to stop at the u.s. virgin islands people working hard .
the fake news networks are working overtime in puerto rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first r's. shame!

my administration will continue to work around the clock with governor @ricardorossello & his team. great progress being made! #prstrong
a great day in puerto rico yesterday. while some of the news coverage is fake most showed great warmth and friendship.
wow so many fake news stories today. no matter what i do or say they will not write or speak truth. the fake news media is out of control!
nbc news is #fakenews and more dishonest than even cnn. they are a disgrace to good reporting. no wonder their news ratings are way down!
the @nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec. tillerson and @vp pence. it is #fakenews. they should issue an apology to america!
i will be landing in las vegas shortly to pay my respects with @flotus melania. everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.
we love you las vegas!
on behalf of a grateful nation thank you to all of the first responders heroes who saved countless lives in las vegas on sunday night.
so wonderful to be in las vegas yesterday and meet with people from police to doctors to the victims themselves who i will never forget!

late night host are dealing with the democrats for their very unfunny & repetitive material always anti-trump! should we get equal time?
more and more people are suggesting that republicans and me should be given equal time on t.v. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
i called chuck schumer yesterday to see if the dems want to do a great healthcare bill. obamacare is badly broken big premiums. who knows!
.@nbcnews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting. the good news is that the people get it which is really all that matters! not #1

i asked @vp pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled disrespecting our country. i am proud of him and @secondlady karen.
fema and first responders are working hard yet again on hurricane nate. military helping. very much under control!
bob corker gave us the iran deal & that's about it. we need healthcare we need tax cuts reform we need people that can get the job done!
nobody could have done what ive done for #puertorico with so little appreciation. so much work!
the republican party is racking up record amounts of small dollar donations - fueled by trump supporters..... @nypost thank you!
our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with north korea for 25 years giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. policy didn't work!
the trip by @vp pence was long planned. he is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!

the democrats in the southwest part of virginia have been abandoned by their party. republican ed gillespie will never let you down!
the failing @nytimes in a story by peter baker should have mentioned the rapid terminations by me of tpp & the paris accord & the fast....
...approvals of the keystone xl & dakota access pipelines. also look at the recent epa cancelations & our great new supreme court justice!
art laffer just said that he doesn't know how a democrat could vote against the big tax cut reform bill and live with themselves! @foxnews

...people not interviewed including clinton herself. comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? where is justice dept?
the democrats will only vote for tax increases. hopefully all senate republicans will vote for the largest tax cuts in u.s. history.
as it has turned out james comey lied and leaked and totally protected hillary clinton. he was the best thing that ever happened to her!
the nfl has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our national anthem. total disrespect for our great country!

getting ready to make a major speech to the national assembly here in south korea then will be headed to china where i very much look forward to meeting with president xi who is just off his great political victory.
ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for. dont forget republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats and with the economy doing record numbers we will continue to win even bigger than before!
join me live in south korea#nationalassembly #potusinasia
the u.s. under my administration is completely rebuilding its military and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world being built right now. i want peace through strength!
the north korean regime has pursued its nuclear & ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance agreement & commmitment it has made to the u.s. and its allies. it's broken all of those commitments...
anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the u.s. should look to our past....and you will doubt it no longer.
together we dream of a korea that is free a peninsula that is safe and families that are reunited once again!
leaving south korea now heading to china. looking very much forward to meeting and being with president xi!
on behalf of @flotus melania and i thank you for an unforgettableafternoon and eveningat theforbidden city in beijing president xi and madame peng liyuan. we are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!
noko has interpreted america's past restraint as weakness. this would be a fatal miscalculation. do not underestimate us. and do not try us.
looking forward to a full day of meetings with president xi and our delegations tomorrow. thank you for the beautiful welcome china! @flotus melania and i will never forget it!
congratulations to all of the deplorables and the millions of people who gave us a massive 304-227 electoral college landslide victory!
president xi thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony. it was a truly memorable and impressive display!
in the coming months and years ahead i look forward to building an even stronger relationship between the united states and china.
i dont blame china i blame the incompetence of past admins for allowing china to take advantage of the u.s. on trade leading up to a point where the u.s. is losing $100's of billions. how can you blame china for taking advantage of people that had no clue? i would've done same!
my meetings with president xi jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of north korea. he is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. it was great being with him and madame peng liyuan!
i am leaving china for #apec2017 in vietnam. @flotus melania is staying behind to see the zoo and of course the great wall of china before going to alaska to greet our amazing troops.
just landed in da nang vietnam to deliver a speech at #apec2017
throughout my travels i've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from america. i've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free & open indo-pacific -- a place where sovereign & independent nations w diverse cultures & many different dreams can all prosper side-by-side.
in more and more places throughout this region citizens of sovereign and independent nations have taken greater control of their destinies and unlocked the potential of their people. #apec2017
today i am here to offer a renewed partnership with america -- to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the indo-pacific and together to promote our prosperity and security. #apec2017
the united states is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interests of both your countries and mine. that is the message i am here to deliver today. #apec2017
the united states has been reminded time and again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security -economic security is national security. it is vital to our national strength. #apec2017
the united states has been reminded time and again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security - economic security is national security. it is vital to our national strength. #apec2017

presidential proclamation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the vietnam war
president xi of china has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #noko. said he wants them to denuclearize. progress is being made.
will be doing a joint press conference in hanoi vietnam then heading for final destination of trip the phillipines.
met with president putin of russia who was at #apec meetings. good discussions on syria. hope for his help to solve along with china the dangerous north korea crisis. progress being made.
when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing. there always playing politics - bad for our country. i want to solve north korea syria ukraine terrorism and russia can greatly help!
does the fake news media remember when crooked hillary clinton as secretary of state was begging russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with putin.
why would kim jong-un insult me by calling me old when i would never call him short and fat? oh well i try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
just landed in the philippines after a great day of meetings and events in hanoi vietnam!

happy to announce i am nominating alex azar to be the next hhs secretary. he will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
i am proud of the rep. house & senate for working so hard on cutting taxes & reform. were getting close! now how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular indiv mandate in ocare & reducing taxes even further? cut top rate to 35 w all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
excited to be heading home to see the house pass a great tax bill with the middle class getting big tax cuts!#makeamericagreatagain
great to see @randpaul looking well and back on the senate floor. he will help us with tax cuts and reform!
after my tour of asia all countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed. the united states has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion. the massive trade deficits must go down quickly!
just arrived at #asean50 in the philippines for my final stop with world leaders. will lead to fair trade deals unlike the horror shows from past administrations. will then be leaving for d.c. made many good friends!
i will be making a major statement from the @whitehouse upon my return to d.c. time and date to be set.
one of the most accurate polls last time around. but #fakenews likes to say were in the 30s. they are wrong. some people think numbers could be in the 50's. together we will make america great again!
thank you to the amazing staff and their families of the united states embassy in the philippines. keep up the great work!
thank you asia! #usa
may god be with the people of sutherland springs texas. the fbi and law enforcement has arrived.

our great country is respected again in asia. you will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!
.@foxandfriends will be showing much of our successful trip to asia and the friendships & benefits that will endure for years to come!
while in the philippines i was forced to watch @cnn which i have not done in months and again realized how bad and fake it is. loser!
thank you working hard!
thank you!
do you think the three ucla basketball players will say thank you president trump? they were headed for 10 years in jail!
the failing @nytimes hates the fact that i have developed a great relationship with world leaders like xi jinping president of china.....
...they should realize that these relationships are a good thing not a bad thing. the u.s. is being respected again. watch trade!
it is actually hard to believe how naive or dumb the failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!
why are democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business jobs ? the reason: obstruction and delay!
big vote tomorrow in the house. tax cuts are getting close!
to the three ucla basketball players i say: you're welcome go out and give a big thank you to president xi jinping of china who made.....
....your release possible and have a great life! be careful there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!
china is sending an envoy and delegation to north korea - a big move we'll see what happens!
need all on the un security council to vote to renew the joint investigative mechanism for syria to ensure that assad regime does not commit mass murder with chemical weapons ever again.
congratulations to the house of representatives for passing the #taxcutsandjobsact a big step toward fulfilling our promise to deliver historic tax cuts for the american people by the end of the year!
big win today in the house for gop tax cuts and reform 227-205. zero dems they want to raise taxes much higher but not for our military!
the al frankenstien picture is really bad speaks a thousand words. where do his hands go in pictures 2 3 4 5 & 6 while she sleeps? .....
.and to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women. lesley stahl tape?
great numbers on stocks and the economy. if we get tax cuts and reform we'll really see some great results!
if democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes we would be able to get many of their ideas into bill!
together we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities and we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel #ms13 and many other gangs...'hundreds arrested in ms-13 crackdown'
today it was an honor to celebrate the collegiate national champions of 2016 2017 at the @whitehouse! #ncaachampionsphotos:
put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as i review all conservation facts. under study for years. will update soon with secretary zinke. thank you!
crooked hillary clinton is the worst and biggest loser of all time. she just cant stop which is so good for the republican party. hillary get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail lavar ball the father of liangelo is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. i should have left them in jail!
sen. jeff flake y who is unelectable in the great state of arizona quit race anemic polls was caught purposely on mike saying bad things about your favorite president. hell be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is toast.
shoplifting is a very big deal in china as it should be 5-10 years in jail but not to father lavar. should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead. china told them why they were released. very ungrateful!
big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal.
border patrol officer killed at southern border another badly hurt. we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. we will and must build the wall!
republican senators are working very hard to get tax cuts and tax reform approved. hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the american public!
marshawn lynch of the nfls oakland raiders stands for the mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem. great disrespect! next time nfl should suspend him for remainder of season. attendance and ratings way down.

president donald j. trump and @flotus melania participate in the pardoning of the national thanksgiving turkey at the white house.
today we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house. drumstick and wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful blue ridge mountains at gobblers rest...
it wasnt the white house it wasnt the state department it wasnt father lavars so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me. too bad! lavar is just a poor mans version of don king but without the hair. just think..
...lavar you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china but no nba contract to support you. but remember lavar shoplifting is not a little thing. its a really big deal especially in china. ungrateful fool!
the nfl is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season. thats almost as bad as kneeling! when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? this issue is killing your league!.....
another crooked hillary fan!

obamacare premiums are going up up up just as i have been predicting for two years. obamacare is owned by the democrats and it is a disaster. but do not worry. even though the dems want to obstruct we will repeal & replace right after tax cuts!
a great guy with great ratings !
two great people!
can you believe that the disrespect for our country our flag our anthem continues without penalty to the players. the commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. players are the boss!
will be speaking to president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that i inherited in the middle east. i will get it all done but what a mistake in lives and dollars 6 trillion to be there in the first place!
after turkey call i will be heading over to trump national golf club jupiter to play golf quickly with tiger woods and dustin johnson. then back to mar-a-lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the usa!
horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in egypt. the world cannot tolerate terrorism we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
will be calling the president of egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack with so much loss of life. we have to get tougher and smarter than ever before and we will. need the wall need the ban! god bless the people of egypt.
time magazine called to say that i was probably going to be named man person of the year like last year but i would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. i said probably is no good and took a pass. thanks anyway!
happy #smallbusinesssaturday!a great day to support your community and americas job creators by shopping locally at a #smallbiz. #shopsmall
the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb has been a total disaster as run by the previous administrations pick. financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. we will bring it back to life!
check out the recent editorial in the wall street journal @wsj about what a complete disaster the @cfpb has been under its leader from previous administration who just quit!
.@foxnews is much more important in the united states than cnn but outside of the u.s. cnn international is still a major source of fake news and they represent our nation to the world very poorly. the outside world does not see the truth from them!
wow even i didnt realize we did so much. wish the fake news would report! thank you.
the last thing we need in alabama and the u.s. senate is a schumer pelosi puppet who is weak on crime weak on the border bad for our military and our great vets bad for our 2nd amendment and wants to raises taxes to the sky. jones would be a disaster!
i endorsed luther strange in the alabama primary. he shot way up in the polls but it wasnt enough. cant let schumer pelosi win this race. liberal jones would be bad!
since the first day i took office all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election russia russiarussia. despite this i have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month president. make america great again!
back in d.c. big week for tax cuts and many other things of great importance to our country. senate republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. the tax cut bill is getting better and better. the end result will be great for all!
we should have a contest as to which of the networks plus cnn and not including fox is the most dishonest corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president me . they are all bad. winner to receive the fake news trophy!
the good news is that their ratings are terrible nobody cares!
the tax cut bill is coming along very well great support. with just a few changes some mathematical the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
new home sales reach a 10 year high. stock market has more record gains. hopefully republican senators will give us the much needed tax cuts to keep it all going! democrats want big tax increases.
thank you rand!
at least 24 players kneeling this weekend at nfl stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. the american public is fed up with the disrespect the nfl is paying to our country our flag and our national anthem. weak and out of control!
melania our great and very hard working first lady who truly loves what she is doing always thought that if you run you will win. she would tell everyone that no doubt he will win. i also felt i would win or i would not have run - and country is doing great!

dow s&p 500 and nasdaq all finished the day at new record highs!
the conference board said that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in nearly 17 years in november. the consumer confidence index rose from 126.2 in october to 129.5 notching its best reading since december 2000...
after north korea missile launch it's more important than ever to fund our gov't & military! dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty & illegal immigration. i ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. they can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
charles mccullough the respected fmr intel comm inspector general said public was misled on crooked hillary emails. emails endangered national security. why arent our deep state authorities looking at this? rigged & corrupt? @tuckercarlson @seanhannity
just won the lawsuit on leadership of consumer financial protection bureau cfpb. a big win for the consumer!

looks like another great day for the stock market. consumer confidence is at record high. i guess somebody likes me my policies !
wow matt lauer was just fired from nbc for inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace. but when will the top executives at nbc & comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news. check out andy lacks past!
so now tha matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago? investigate!
so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the unsolved mystery that took place in florida years ago? investigate!

economy growing! excluding hurricane effects cea estimates that real gdp growth would have been 3.9 in q3.stock market at a new high unemployment at a low. we are winning and tax cuts will shift our economy into high gear!
departing @jba nafw for st. charles missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line.a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the american people!
this week the senate can join the house & take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of america. together we will give the american people a big beautiful christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets americans keep more of their hard-earned money!
a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first. it is time to take care of our workers to protect our communities and to rebuild our great country!
now we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore american prosperity and reclaim americas destiny.but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future the senate must pass tax cuts and bring main street roaring back to life!

the house of representatives seeks contempt citations ? against the justicedepartment and the fbi for withholding key documents and an fbi witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of donald trump. big stuff. deep state. give this information now! @foxnews
the only people who dont like the tax cut bill are the people that dont understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans!
had the information crooked hillarys emails been released there would have been harm to national security.... charles mcculloughfmr intel comm inspector general
funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president obama doubled it in only 8 years!
the failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the democrat party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill. they are wrong so often that now i know we have a winner!
the failing @nytimes has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue! @foxandfriends
the chinese envoy who just returned from north korea seems to have had no impact on little rocket man. hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. russia and china condemned the launch.
stock market hits new record high. confidence and enthusiasm abound. more great numbers coming out!
the dow just broke 24000 for the first time another all-time record . if the dems had won the presidential election the market would be down 50 from these levels and consumer confidence which is also at an all-time high would be low and glum!
thank you @senorrinhatch. lets continue making america great again!
today it was my great honor to meet with the crown prince of bahrain at the @whitehouse. bahrain and the united states are important partners.during the crown princes visit he is advancing $9 billion in commercial deals including finalizing the purchase of f-16s...
our fifth 1k milestone of 2017!#dow24k #maga
today is a day that ive been looking very much forward to all year long. it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before. now as president of the united states it is my tremendous honor to finally wish america and the world a very merry christmas!
the christmas story begins 2000 years ago with a mother a father their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of allthe gift of gods love for all of humanity.whatever our beliefs we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life...
a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.
the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. build the wall!
the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon. the schumer pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.
republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. the bill is getting better and better. this is a once in a generation chance. obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
the media has been speculating that i fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - fake news! hes not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects i call the final shots we work well together and america is highly respected again!
economists on the tax cuts and jobs act:the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations...
we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america. special thanks to @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and chairman @senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate. look forward to signing a final bill before christmas!
biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate. now these great republicans will be going for final passage. thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment!
i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi. he has pled guilty to those lies. it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. there was nothing to hide!
62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in montgomery alabama uttered one word that changed history...
great job first lady melania!
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed while crooked hillary clinton on that now famous fbi holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? rigged system or just a double standard?
many people in our country are asking what the justice department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and acid washed 33000 emails? no justice!
congratulations to @abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia russia russia witch hunt. more networks and papers should do the same with their fake news!
i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn. just more fake news covering another comey lie!
such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco!
tainted no very dishonest? fbi agents role in clinton probe under review. led clinton email probe. @foxandfriends clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge.
after years of comey with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation and more running the fbi its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! but fear not we will bring it back to greatness.
people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of @abc news he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
report: anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe now it all starts to make sense!
democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration border wall military pro life v.a. judges 2nd amendment and more. no to jones a pelosi schumer puppet!
putting pelosi schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders...& so much more. look at your 401-ks since election. highest stock market ever! jobs are roaring back!
with the great vote on cutting taxes this could be a big day for the stock market - and you!
a must watch: legal scholar alan dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in u.s. political history. enjoy!

national pearl harbor remembrance day - a day that will live in infamy! december 7 1941
today our entire nation pauses to remember pearl harborand the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for america. god bless our heroes who wear the uniform and god bless the united states of america. #pearlharborremembranceday
today the u.s. flag flies at half-staff at the @whitehouse in honor of national pearl harbor remembrance day.
today as we remember pearl harbor it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving veterans of the attack on 12 7 1941. they are heroes and they are living witnesses to american history. all american hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice.
across the battlefields oceans and harrowing skies of europe and the pacific throughout the war one great battle cry could be heard by americas friends and foes alike:remember pearl harbor.
tonight @flotus melania and i were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @whitehouse and wish them all a very #happyhanukkah
i fulfilled my campaign promise - others didnt!
big crowd expected today in pensacola florida for a make america great again speech. we have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! see you there!
last thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already. the pelosi schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100 of the time. hes bad on crime life border vets guns & military. vote roy moore!
fines and penalties against wells fargo bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. i will cut regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
make america great again!

a big contingent of very enthusiastic roy moore fans at the rally last night. we cant have a pelosi schumer liberal democrat jones in that important alabama senate seat. need your vote to make america great again! jones will always vote against what we must do for our country.
fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. they were caught red handed just like lonely brian ross at abc news who should be immediately fired for his mistake . watch to see if @cnn fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?
cnns slogan is cnn the most trusted name in news. everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the american public. there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn. their slogan should be cnn the least trusted name in news!
heading to the great state of mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected governor @philbryantms. look forward to seeing the new civil rights museum!

.@daveweigel @washingtonpost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before i arrived @ the venue w thousands of people outside on their way in. real photos now shown as i spoke. packed house many people unable to get in. demand apology & retraction from fake news wapo!
.@daveweigel of the washington post just admitted that his picture was a fake fraud? showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed as shown also on t.v. . fake news he should be fired.

great army - navy game. army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chiefs trophy! congratulations!
no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. our cities should be sanctuaries for americans not for criminal aliens!
things are going really well for our economy a subject the fake news spends as little time as possible discussing! stock market hit another record high unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the usa. really good news and much more to come!
getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill. shaping up even better than projected. house and senate working very hard and smart. end result will be not only important but special!
very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media. they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on america!
another false story this time in the failing @nytimes that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong! also i seldom if ever watch cnn or msnbc both of which i consider fake news. i never watch don lemon who i once called the dumbest man on television! bad reporting.
despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i dont know and or have never met. fake news!
lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used!
the people of alabama will do the right thing. doug jones is pro-abortion weak on crime military and illegal immigration bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall. jones is a pelosi schumer puppet. roy moore will always vote with us. vote roy moore!
consumer confidence is at an all-time high along with a record high stock market. unemployment is at a 17 year low. make america great again! working to pass massive tax cuts looking good .
wishing all of those celebrating #hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.
congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory. the write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. the people of alabama are great and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. it never ends!
the reason i originally endorsed luther strange and his numbers went up mightily is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election. i was right! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
wow more than 90 of fake news media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. hence my use of social media the only way to get the truth out. much of mainstream meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends
if last nights election proved anything it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.
thank you omarosa for your service! i wish you continued success.
republican tax cuts are looking very good. all are working hard. in the meantime the stock market hit another record high!
as a candidate i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working americans. if you make your voices heard this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism prosperity and pride!
today we gathered in the roosevelt room for one single reason: to cut the red tape! for many decades an ever-growing maze of regs rules and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars millions of jobs countless american factories & devastated entire industries.
when americans are free to thrive innovate & prosper there is no challenge too great no task too large & no goal beyond our reach. we are a nation of explorers pioneers innovators & inventors. we are nation of people who work hard dream big & who never ever give up...
in 1960 there were approximately 20000 pages in the code of federal regulations. today there are over 185000 pages as seen in the roosevelt room.today we cut the red tape! it is time to set free our dreams and make america great again!
